"#HolbyCity have confirmed to me that Serena's final episode will be on the 21st January 2020 . It ’ s sad that people are celebrating this but I can ’ t help thinking that CR has been the author of her own downfall .  It is sad . But Serena has been destroyed . Difficult to know how big a part CR has played in that but can't help but feel June 2018 would have been a far better time to leave with both Serena's and CR's dignity and popularity intact   The irony is that when the storyline imploded earlier this year , JR had left & her popularity rocketed . CR stayed & her popularity & integrity vanished into thin air ? ? 🤔   It's sad that I don't feel sad about this . Serena's character was well and truly wrecked , and given by her shenanigans on Twitter , particularly the gaslighting of fans , I believe she had a hand in this . It backfired and I , for one , am happy to see her go .   I suspect her twittering may hinder her career which is a shame but ...   Well her agent or agents should be giving her guidance . Arguing and being snippy with the people who put you on the pedestal you decided to jump from . Not a good idea really   We've all been led to believe that CR decision to leave Holby , a decision made months ago , was to head for pastures new ! Why continue to be snippy & antagonistic towards people , who in the great scheme of things , are totally irrelevant now ? Guess we hit a nerve somewhere ?   I think she is genuinely hurt by how this has turned out . I think she felt they did the right by #berena . And we are wrong to be critical . She has left at a point when her character was at an all time low and I do think a glorious final year became let ’ s keep it simple .   I agree . I think she had no idea that it would all go so horribly wrong . Perhaps they believed their own thoughts . I feel sorry for her as she was in too deep without support . But it demonstrates how wlw writers and advisors need to be involved and egos put aside   The way #berena ended upset so many people and I'm sure it wasn't on her but she played a part . However , I do believe she was out on her own . The writers left her up the creek without a paddle . They avoided the social media torment , she could not . But I am glad she's going .   I agree with everything said . I do feel sorry for her abit . After all she was one part of a fabulous bit of initial rep . I believe she was not ready for the adulation and the fallout . She seemed to completely unsupported when it went wrong and I think her leaving is related .   I do think her behaviour on Twitter leaves a lot to be desired . She hasn't . helped herself at all !   I just feel sad about that . I ’ m blocked . No doubt about that . She has only devoted fans who really see her as infallible . That ’ s really sad . But equally I do understand that a highly critical and sometimes abusive onslaught can be debilitating .   Agree the critical onslaught could have been unwelcome , so surely an explanation from someone , BBC / Holby , even CR herself could have prevented further distress .

"As this grim and dismaying year winds down , the story is , for me , the successful destruction of the Labour party by the BBC . 1We have the most right wing press in Europe :  also the least trusted :  2The role of the BBC is , thus , critical . Operating in a sea of commercial press and broadcasters which are almost exclusively right or centre , BBC ’ s self-proclaimed ‘ impartiality ’ is the bulwark . 3The bulwark failed . BBC become just another right-wing voice , pumping out the same hate and bigotry as every other right-wing news outlet . 4BBC failed the UK . It allowed Corbyn and the left to be turned into an Aunt Sally , a punchbag for every angry stupid right-wing BBC jerk to have a go at . It became a monstrous bully . 5BBC ’ s role in the future looks uncertain . Johnson seems inclined to make threatening noises , presumably so BBC can claim the ‘ both sides criticise us so we must be doing something right ’ argument beloved of ignorant Tories . 6Like someone watching a car crash and saying , ‘ Yes I ’ ve got a bit of a sore knee as well , I need an ambulance too . ’ 7BBC News breached its Charter in every broadcast of the last 4 years . BBC news broke election purdah rules just about every day of the campaign . BBC became a lawless free-for-all , in which Corbyn-hating voices , no matter how compromised or cynical , were given uncritical space . 8BBC topical comedy became infected also : Labour antisemitism ‘ jokes ’ right across BBC ’ s comedy output . Doubly corrosive , because delivered by faces we love and trust ( or used to ) because they make us laugh . 9BBC has lost the left , probably for good . Anecdotally , leftsists are cancelling their DDs and switching it off , permanently . It ’ s hated in a way I ’ ve never seen before . 10Whether this matters to it or not is unclear : recent pronouncements about ‘ conspiracy theories ’ from DG Baron Hall and Huw Edwards are not encouraging : they have learned nothing , seemingly , and are in denial about what ’ s happened . 11BBC stumbles on , corrupt , stupid , bigoted and blind . The country needs it to be impartial for democracy to have any chance , and BBC abandoned its impartiality a long time ago . 12Until BBC is fixed , UK will continue to be broken , and the Labour party will continue to be crucified by it . Labour could have taken action : instead they aligned themselves with the bullies . If you don ’ t fight you get beaten , which is of course what happened on Dec 12 . 13We are in crisis . Labour is in crisis . The country is in crisis . BBC is in crisis . And the crisis will continue whilst BBC exists in its present form . We deserve and need better than this , and we ’ re not going to get it . We are a failed state , with a failed state broadcaster . 14   I do .

And even worse , now claim i am harming myself somehow and acting like porn is available to minors when it's for 18 plus  So please dont tell me what is and isnt disingenuous when you've done all those things in your tweet . If you want to believe porn is harmful . Fine , that's your opinion . But stop stating it like it's a fact when you've yet to back that claim up .  It has everything to do with the discussion . Govt regulates harmful ( incl . immoral ) things , esp . for minors . Not a controversial claim , but it obv . made you feel defensive - and in turn flippant : "" ArE yOu TrYiNg To SaY iT's LiKe MuRdEr ? ? "" 1 /  You don't agree it's harmful ? That's fine , you can simply say as much without getting angry : "" I disagree about the useful affects . Many studies show the exact opposite . "" See ? That's not so hard - for someone who's being honest . 2 /  At any rate , us "" right-wingers "" believe it IS harmful - mostly to the spirit . Which is why scientific studies are so mixed - they can't quantify it exactly . 3 /  But SUPPOSE we're right , just for second . Then it would make sense for govt to regulate it like other serious things . Maybe with an outright ban , like murder ; or maybe with regulation , like alcohol . Maybe it's ok for adults , but we need to keep it away from minors . 4 /  Point is , t's not a "" weird "" position to have - we simply disagree . If it triggers you so badly to have someone disagree with you , then further discussion is pointless . I'm going to enjoy my Sunday ; but feel free to shout your anger into the wind . / End","  Ok , let's get a few things correct .

"So how do you power a spaceship through the void between stars ? Well , we KNOW matter is energy , but how do we get it to degrade ONLY into plasma , i . e . heat ? Also , if we found a way to stimulate energy to release copious amounts of plasma , then won't it pop in the last decay ?Thus destroying whatever technology around it , which is stimulating the energy to release copious amounts of plasma ? Also , how do you stimulate energy to release plasma without having to put excess energy into the system ? I mean , the vibrational variance between oxidation ...states of atoms is enough to cause them to release plasma , i . e . current rock technology . Therefore , the real question is : Can a dissonant vibrational pattern around the energy cause it to LOSE the "" strings "" that holds all the plasma together ? ( That was sarcasm ? ) Or ...does the dissonant vibrational pattern of the stimuli cause the moving bits of energy to rub the wrong way , in their complexity , to release plasma ? I KNOW energy is ONLY equal to mc2 , based upon our archaic methods of smashing with rock , but what if a dissonant energy pattern ...results in a billion kilo joules of plasma over the lifetime of one proton ? Much in the say way the vibration of the Distal Matter in the sun , causes all those protons to decay faster ? I mean , whatever is vibrating in the Sun is causing the protons to lose strings ... and plasma ?So let me reiterate the OUTSTANDING point : The vibration of the plasma , in the Sun , is causing the matter to decay at an exponential rates , which we perceive as energy ... and then relate back to MASS ... as it relates to the energy ... to explain how the sun releases so MUCH ...","energy via FUSION , I mean , "" string "" and plasma release ?

"This makes it only about Muslims but the NRC process had more non-Muslim victims . CAA seeks to mitigate effect on non-Muslims but even a small percentage on the large base will mean a lot of victims . All Indians should be worried for themselves as much as for their neighbors .

"I strongly encourage all #Bernie2020 supporters to ignore trash like this . As someone who has a foot in both camps ( Bernie 2020 & the YangGang ) I can tell you this is nothing but a nasty smear against a natural ally and POTENTIAL VOTERS .   Yang is not a natural ally , he's pro capitalism and wants to reinforce it with placative measures to keep the poor from realizing class consciousness . He actively opposes leftist ideology .   If you truly do not support Yang that ’ s OK . But time is better spent getting politically disengaged citizens to vote rather than trying to smear or attack other candidates and their supporters . There are millions of people who don ’ t vote but can . Let ’ s focus our efforts on that .   I'm focusing my efforts on getting people to vote for bernie sanders because he is the only leftist candidate , spreading class consciousness , ensuring that all people are provided for , and building a coalition of the working class .   That's really awesome , keep at it ! I hope you understand from my point of view how your tweet came off . I don't think we should point fingers at each other . Remember when Hillary basically blamed Bernie for losing ( heck she still does ) ? It's just not the attitude we should have   the issue is that yang supporters do not understand the concept of leftism and the struggle against the ruling class . i'm attacking yang because he fundamentally opposes leftism and supports right libertarian ideals   Regardless of how you might label his policies , most Americans would benefit the mist from them . That ’ s the problem I tend to see amongst Bernie supporters , you can ’ t seem to separate ideology from practicality .   the problem is in the yang gangs lack of critical analysis of yang's plans . UBI funded by VAT is the poor paying themselves , and also the rich , it's regressive as hell . it also does nothing to benefit those already receiving the bare minimum in SSI / SSDI   40 hour week , 48 weeks , that's a total of another $ 28k between 2 adults . Total projected income after UBI ? 52k . You not even gonna convince yourself that UBI isn't a better option .   UBI is great . UBI payed for by taxing consumption and eliminating welfare programs is not great , it is a placative measure to perpetuate the latest stages of capitalism .   Again , if you were to criticize UBI , at least get your facts right . UBI does not eliminate any existing welfare programs .   allow me to correct my semantic error . UBI is great . YANG'S VERSION OF UBI payed for by taxing consumption and SLOWLY eliminating welfare programs is not great , it is a placative measure to perpetuate the latest stages of capitalism .   Also funny how so suddenly people have always had an ideal version of UBI until confronted with Yang ’ s , the only candidate to ever propose the policy and to essentially propel it into mainstream politics .

"This is quite a painful thread for me to write . But it needs saying . We've just lived through a period in which many charged with protecting British Jews have done the exact opposite . I'm referring here especially to the Chief Rabbi , Board of Deputies and Jewish Chronicle .Completely in the face of the evidence , a narrative was created by the media , and doubled down on by those I mention above . This narrative blamed those who can always be found on the front line fighting AGAINST all forms of racism for antisemitism .At the same time , as antisemitism on the right and far right rose , rose and rose some more , the response was ... nothing . Nothing whatsoever . The organisations and individuals I've referred to above simply DO NOT CARE about most Jews . That's what their record shows .And as they do not care about most Jews , the following is likely to happen : 1 . Any attacks such as the latest awful ones will be blamed on the left , regardless of reality . 2 . This will cause ever more panic among British Jews .3 . If any left wing Jews are attacked , heaven help them . Because as their record proves , those whose responsibility it is to protect them will do not the slightest thing . 4 . Antisemitism will continue to rise from the far right : whose existence is being normalised .Don't expect the individuals and organisations I mentioned in the OP to magically come to their senses . THEY DON'T CARE . Least of all about anyone poor , disabled , vulnerable , or left wing .Already , we've seen an online campaign to somehow blame these latest atrocities on the left . Already , we are seeing absurd , revolting attempts to paint Bernie Sanders as an antisemite . This will only get worse . The only cure is education and solidarity . #NoPasaranWhen Michael Rosen - MICHAEL ROSEN ! ! - is persistently attacked and smeared for the crime of caring with all his heart for all his fellow Jews ( and for humanity itself ) , what's going on here couldn't be clearer . Not least when the person insulting him is followed by blue ticks .The past 3 years or so have seen the most hysterical , disgusting campaign of smears and lies I have ever known in British politics or British public life . That's not going to magically stop now . Facts no longer matter . Evidence no longer matters .Those responsible for this are interested only in the following : 1 . Attention ( in the case of celebrities ) 2 . Clicks and newspaper sales ( in the case of the Jewish Chronicle ) 3 . The defeat of the leftNone of them are remotely interested in the defeat of antisemitism . They couldn't be less so . And you know how I know that ? Because Britain has a prime minister who personally profited from antisemitism for YEARS ... and these organisations rejoiced in his victory .The House of Commons , meanwhile , has a leader who has repeatedly propagated horrendous antisemitic tropes ; as has the prime minister's special adviser . Again : none of them say a single damn word .The Jewish Chronicle has been referred by IPSO for sanctions due to its false , evidence-free demonisation of a Labour activist , after an investigation with which it refused to cooperate . This is far from the first time it's been in trouble either .And the Chief Rabbi himself makes an outrageous intervention into an election campaign to inquire about Britain's ' moral compass ' ... while the poor get poorer , disabled people take their own lives , and austerity claims hundreds of thousands of victims . Under the party he backs .Sam Kriss refers to all of this as the war against the Jews . He's right . And what he had to say should be read by all . But as Sam Kriss is a left wing Jew , for these people and these organisations , he's therefore the wrong kind of Jew . Or even , a non-Jew . Because goodness knows , voices like his , Rosen's or so many others must at all costs be drowned out by nonsense and hysteria .Down this road lies absolute catastrophe . When so-called civilised societies abandon evidence , abandon reason , abandon any sense whatsoever of community , solidarity or the ties which bind us all , catastrophe is always what results .And when it does , those responsible for this disgusting campaign will , I'm sure , continue to blame the left ... even as the left does everything in its power to help . Orwell and 1984 , eat your heart out . 🤷 ‍ ♀ ️ Labour opened its doors to any crank & thug with £ 3 in his bin , gave them all a vote & ended up with the cranks in charge . Until it puts this right , it will be blamed for the consequences . It ’ s not * hard *","  🙄 that's "" right "" only those with money should be allowed to join any political party , if they're poor they should be denied a voice in the political party they support , the poor are unworthy of having a say for the crime of being poor , in fact disallow the poor a vote",0

"That's a good point . I can't help but wonder if they think women priests will actually show them up by doing a bett …  The Anglicans don't seem to have any problems with female clergy ( Including bishops ! ) I know .

But I do wonder for how many it has been about access & opportunity , & the fucked-up rules they have to obey .

No , but being part of a system that says you can't express your sexuality properly doesn't help  Unfortunately , they are expressing their sexuality . Pedos , that is . What needs to happen is better screening .  Not all men who have gay sex in prison would classify themselves as gay . This is more complex .  Yup . They're sexual predators , and as adults they're also using their authority as priests to pressure kids .  They know what they're doing is wrong , unfortunately . If it's just about sex , there are less evil ways to cope .  I know . The issues are more complex than 140 characters can allow .  It is . The big issue is the Vatican . They hide behind their status as a nation far too often .

"   I'm saying that the argument of gun control leaves guns with criminals , or they will kill somehow anyway so may as well be a gun , are tired overused propaganda from the NRA . No one is going to take all the guns . Believing they'll try is idiotic . Common sense control is a must .   But every proposal affects only the law-abiding , and does next to nothing to stop criminals . Universal background checks ? Long waiting periods ? Criminals can still steal guns or buy them on the black market . "" Assault weapon "" bans ? Ineffective at saving lives . What's your idea ?   And what we're doing now is saving lives and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals ? ?   Yes , violent crime is trending downwards . But I agree that more should be done to stop dangerous people . Widespread education on safe storage of firearms and the importance of theft prevention would be helpful . But people don't want gun education in schools .   We could allow the general public to access the NICS background check system so they can verify who they're selling a gun to without paying a gun dealer to run the check for them . But nobody has proposed that .   It depends on the dealer . Around me , it's usually around $ 25-30 . Add in the time and hassle of butter and seller finding a gun store that's open at a time convenient to both , and an unfortunate number of people might just say "" Eh , I'm sure you're fine "" and selling the gun .   Then it would be an illegal sale if 100 % background checks become law .   It's an illegal sale anyways , because it's illegal for a criminal to buy guns . That's why they steal them ( which is illegal ) , or use straw purchasers ( which is also illegal ) . You could pass 100 % background check laws , but it will only affect people who obey the law anyway .   It would flag people with mental health issues , domestic violence arrests , etc .    It could , but it could fail , too . Especially when people just don't obey the law . That's why I prefer giving people other than gun dealers access to NICS checks . It's not a burden on the law-abiding , but it will give them the ability to avoid selling to anyone who is prohibited . The Aurora , Illinois shooter was a prohibited possessor , yet he was abled to buy a gun at a store because NICS failed . Also , the vast majority of criminals obtained their guns through theft or the black market .  Last night my wife's car failed to start and she called be for help . I told her that if it failed once , then it's useless . Don't try and fix it . Don't even buy another one , because if one car fails then all cars are worthless , or at least I WOULD HAVE said that if I were INSANE .  I'm sure your choice to post a gif from the movie that defines your life had nothing to do with your INABILITY to explain how a single failure in a system is justification for discarding the whole system .  Cars fail regularly as well . In fact AAA responded to 32 million calls for service in 2015 , and that's just ONE of the nation's roadside assistance providers . But you keep shining a light on your failure to provide an intelligent reason to discard rather than repair w / those gifs  Maybe because I never said to discard it 🤷 ‍ ♂ ️ I merely showed that it fails .

"So I was reading this thread on the EI forum ( I ’ m not proud of myself I was bored ) . Anyway this so called punter / white knight / possibly another escort was pissed because this escort called Rafaella got a 4 star review . Not a bad review as 5 stars is the maximum number of stars thatcan be given . So he proceeded to slam the reviewer who is a good , honest reviewer a thing which is in short supply these days , especially on a site like Escort Ireland which is renowned for fake reviews . Anyway the usual suspect saps and irate escort alcoholic Nikita UKproceeded to attack this reviewer and other posters who spoke out in his defence . As the night went and started getting into the wee small hours ( well after 3am ) the posts from the white knights and Nikita started getting more abusive , irate and ludicrous . One post in particularby a poster called funboy 71 had me in snorting out loud with laughter at his logic for giving a bad review . Surely this sap cant be serious . According to him a bad review should only be allowed after visiting the escort more than once , ermmm no I don ’ t think so , a bad reviewcan be left after the 1st visit . A bad review after the 3rd visit would have me thinking does this reviewer have a grudge , the 1st 2 reviews sung her praises , a 3rd review that ’ s bad would stink of revenge to me either because the client is pushy , abusive or stalkerish and theescort doesn ’ t want to see that client again . What followed was a honest review by a honest poster being deleted . Now what I do know is this , in the past this escort has been linked to several other escort profiles and allegations of sharing an apartment with up to 4 otherescorts has been quickly shut down by the same irate mob  Link to thread about the so called bad review , review which has now been removed  The sap came forth and identified themselves . They blocked me after his or her tweet . Took their ball and went home . Well that ’ s your opinion and you are free to express it .

But sometimes telling the truth whether it is your truth or not hurts people . If that was your agenda , success . If not think on ... attack everybody but escorts . I'm not attacking anyone and escorts aren't immune from criticism . You are coming across as a sap tbf . Not all escorts are bad , the ones i have mentioned are . Now if you have a problem with that thats fine , but i will not be a doormat for anyone . I'm probably a sap . But there are plenty of escorts that I had issues with but I don't post it all over social media . Just to be clear i deleted the original tweet from my news feed weeks ago about Nikita UK until Oskana , Oxi , Lexie Minx , Mia purple moderator for  the so called american with the eastern European grammar brought it up again . So if she was going to tell lies about it i was going to post the truth and if that meant posting the screenshots to disprove her then that is her own fault not mine .

Wages have stagnated for the working class , largely due to immigration . Too much of anything depreciates value . Simple economics  Simple being the operative word . Widening wealth gap also the result of migration ? #NoBrexit  Erm .. Yes , because the majority of migrants are unskilled , therefor driving wages down for low skilled Brits 🙄  No evidence of that . Unbridled capitalism much easier to prove as cause of stagnating wages #NoBrexit No , it isn't . Too many low skilled workers chasing the same job drives down wages . Common sense alone would indicate that . That's not what's happening . You're making it up . Hidden agenda no doubt . #NoBrexit I live in Brum , when MG Rover went bust 6,000 joined the job queue . Employers who were advertising prior DROPPED salaries . 🙄 And you blame migrants . You're unfit to be a teacher ( if you are , not likely a troll ) #NoBrexit I don't blame migrants at all .

"When senior RBNY players complain about signing HGs or USL players all I read is "" I can't lead "" . Dudes were bailed out by an 18 - year-old in 2018 ( and 2017 ) and are not brave enough to discuss tactics in public . Ok , I ’ ll bite . 1 ) Which players in any team sport “ discuss tactics in public ? ” 2 ) team has made it plain what it thinks about leaders as it ’ s sent the last 3 captains away . If team ethos is “ experience isn ’ t valued , ” it ’ s ok for experienced players to ask for a trade . experienced is not valued ? Luis and BWP got new contracts after they were 30 . Club renewed Royer , Long , Parker , brought Rza . None is a baby . As for Kemar , he had the option not to sign the 2018 contract . 1 ) oldest rostered player currently is 29 . 2 ) Kemar got raise before Long & Parker got PAID . Surely he feels he ’ s worth more . 3 ) As he gets older , he becomes less attractive to a team looking to get younger all the time . any player after 25 is an experienced one . Kemar can ask for more money , but to go after the club plans a year after he got a raise is bs . And to call the club unambitious when the players covering his back were renewed is just a lie . Ambition is subjective . Look at the players brought in over the past 12 months . what was the need for “ big ” signings after 18 ? Sure things didn ’ t work as expected with Rza-Davis and CCJ replacing Adams . The BWP injury was unexpected , but they also underperformed . They are accountable . In a league where if you're standing still , you're falling behind , standing pat isn't a recipe for success . and I believe that has been acknowledge after 2019 . That doesn ’ t mean the club has to raise the salary of a player who got a raise the year before , and is now using the obvious depth signings to absolve himself of any responsibility . The core of your original argument is that Lawrence is saying “ I can ’ t lead . ” I ’ m challenging that .

"1 . I ’ ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I ’ ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is “ razor thin ” . The terrorist orchestrated an attack on the US embassy . His expectation should have been that the US military would kill him . Simple .  If only life were so simple . It ’ s not . The last time the United States killed a major military leader in a foreign country was during World War II , when the American military shot down the plane carrying the Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto .  Iran already knew there are consequences . Now they have no choice but to respond . Now the Iraqi parliament wants us out . To not do so would be violating their sovereignty . Iraq is Iran ’ s . It ’ s over . Let ’ s get out . Other option is war w no plan , dead Americans .  I think you and I agree there are no good options .  When we fought the Cold War we didn ’ t assassinate Russian Generals who had caused the death of Americans and their allies in proxy wars .  Would we have if they orchestrated attacks on our embassies ?  It ’ s called diplomacy . Taking out Soleimani is dangerous . Threatening to take out holy sites is playing into the hands of Jihadis everywhere . He doesn ’ t understand his enemy . He doesn ’ t understand himself .

"Here are my top 10 stories from last year . I ’ m amazed at all God revealed and accomplished through this blog . And I ’ m grateful for every source who entrusted his or her story and information to me . This was a team effort !  I still don ’ t get this . HBF was a subsidiary how ? According to who ? It had a diff board , no ? Also , why didn ’ t anyone fight HBC 1 on HBF donors behalf ? Instead Wisen ,  ,  et al took the pseudo-spiritual high road of silence on theft of donor funds 🤨    The HBF board was there only in theory , according to my sources . HBF was under the HBC elders who had no idea what was going on .   I ’ m not trying to be difficult , but what does “ under the HBC board mean ” ? Are the sources saying that HBC 1 ’ s board was secretly the boss of HBF ? The sources ’ use of “ subsidiary ” makes it sound like there was some kind of actual legal position of authority of one over the other   It wasn't secret . According to former HBF director , Gordon Zwirkoski , James very clearly articulated that he wanted HBF brought under HBC & the HBC elders . HBF allegedly ceased to be a separate 501c3 and became an auxiliary of HBC . At least , that's the narrative .   When does Mr Zwirkoski allege that happened ? What year ? Unless he says 2017 , financial statements , the IL SoS , and the IRS conflict w / his narrative , as far as I can tell . With these various "" open "" EINs , I have big concerns about theft & money laundering   He can ’ t attest to it happening . In fact , he opposed it and that ’ s why James fired him . No one seems to know for sure . My guess is only Fred Adams and James know — and maybe Steve Huston . And maybe they kept separate orgs for the purpose you suggest .   knew . Seems pretty clear here . Also , HBF was renamed Vertical Church Network in Feb 2018 , per IL SoS , and uses the same EIN as HBF , it appears .    Yes , but the confusion was how it ’ s a 501c3 but not a separate legal entity from HBC . Can ’ t remember the term . Auxiliary something .   Integrated auxiliary . My current understanding is that if it were an integrated auxiliary , would have / should have noted it here . I can ask a NFP accounting expert .   Probe your NFP expert . I confess this is a new term for me .   See here  Also , here's a screenshot from the final HBF audited statements by I see no lack of clarity here about what HBF was as a legal entity . If it was an IG of HBC , then why didn't CC say so ?    Moreover , HBF transitioned into VCN ( same EIN and IL corp file number ) . No one is asking if VCN is an integrated auxiliary of HBC , and no action was taken for it not to be . Why ? Because HBF wasn't a IA , in my opinion   If it wasn ’ t an integrated auxiliary as Harvest leaders claimed , then HBC stole from HBF . If it is an IA , then what happened cannot be stealing because HBC & HBF we ’ re legally the same .   Right . More importantly , it means HBC stole from HBF donors . Has any HBC leader , current or former , ever told a straight , complete story when it comes to money or real estate ? Even the folks who aren ’ t “ lying ” don ’ t ever seem to have the full story .   When it comes to HBF , Harvest withheld info from those conducting the financial review . Even Wisen didn ’ t know for sure whether HBF was an integrated auxiliary or not . I couldn ’ t get a straight answer from Harvest about the board . Just a hot mess . GCC should ask for $ HBC owes .   I replied here . Seems to me that the entity relationships are made crystal-clear . I ’ m also not seeing that HBC owes GCC anything . HBC owes donors to HBF , which may include $ given to HBF by the church plants .     Almost all of HBF's budget was from the independent Harvest churches that comprised HBF . When James disbanded HBF , those churches formed GCC . So I think GCC has a right to the $ . Or , the approx 150 churches could seek reimbursement individually , but that would be vry complicated   GCC as an entity wouldn ’ t have a right to that money , in my non-lawyerly opinion , b / c GCC didn ’ t give the money & was formed ex post facto If the stolen money was directly from churches giving the 5 % franchise fee to HBF , then the churches could perhaps band together & sue 1 /","   Besides , Wisen — whose own church doesn ’ t have open books — encouraged / told other HBF men to “ move on , ” not take “ swings at the bride of Christ , ” & coach others to “ follow our lead . ” This is a faux moral high road that plays into the secretive $ culture .

"The fight over trans rights has ignored a key group : pro-trans feminists . Here , leading feminist thinkers told BuzzFeed News why feminism should include trans people . One of the problems with biology , when discussing feminism and trans people , is where it leads , said Prof . Akwugo Emejulu . “ This has always been the dark heart of white , feminist politics : a jealous guarding of the boundaries of who gets to be a woman , said Prof . Emejulu She cited several examples of white feminists excluding women from ethnic minorities , but began with the earliest . This continues to the present day , she said . “ Boundary making is what ’ s crucial here . ” Therefore , she said , excluding trans people is a way of keeping one ’ s position or status . Keeping trans women out is , Prof . Sally Hines said , “ regulating who can belong to a category in order to close down membership , in order to protect the rights of a dominant majority [ white women ] ” .Prof . Emejulu & Prof . Vanita Sundaram argue that for feminism to really deliver equality & emancipation , it must also focus on problems women face as a result of oppression on basis of factors other than their sex : in particular race , class , sexuality , disability , & gender identity . Prof . Sundaram : “ My own research area is violence vs women & girls , and we know that trans women are more vulnerable to violence , harassment , and everyday abuse than other groups of women . So as a feminist and academic , it ’ s my responsibility to advocate for that group of women . ”“ So it has to be a feminism that challenges patriarchy and other systems of hierarchy that are used to oppress , gender identity being one of them , ” Prof . Sundaram . One of the reasons that a war over trans rights has raged more intensely among feminists in the U . K . than in the US , said Prof . Alison Phipps , is “ the blame has been put on to the wrong group , and trans people are carrying the can for problems that are not of their making . ” The idea that simplifying trans women ’ s legal recognition would lead to increase in attacks in toilets or prisons was unfounded . Prof . Phipps said evidence doesn ’ t show trans women to be anything like as sexually violent as men ... while instead being even more likely to be victims Painting trans women as predators when they are routinely victims is unjust . And because perceived threat is not the same as actual threat , policies should be “ based on actual levels of risk , which are low , ” Prof Phipps .", i ’ ve been physically assaulted coming out of the women ’ s washroom by men for that very reason - their ridiculous fragile notion that we are somehow a threat .,0

" ‘ Oumuamua had no outgassing . Sounds like the tic-tac's lack of emissions on the FLIR camera . One wonders if these objects were not kindred spirits . Someone might be kicking objects around the solar system . Chris Mellon thinks NORAD must know . 🛸 Something a lot of people don ’ t bring up is the pilot said one of the TicTacs had little protuberances on it . Just wondering if this could be some kind of braking system questions regarding TTSA's role in this campaign to apparently release secret UFO videos . Is TTSA a disinfo campaign sanctioned by intelligence ? Does TTSA know about this or are they being played ? It becomes very tricky . I saw the first video long before TTSA it was on YouTube . Have no clue who released it then . Only the parts the pentagon wanted the public to see has been released why ? To convince us there is a threat from unknowns ? I would love to see the videos released in their entirety . Why , then , are the Pentagoons denying the veracity of the video ? Or walking it back , or whatever they're doing ? Blow-back ? If they released it as message to Russians / Chinese , perhaps unintended consequence of ppl now believing aliens exist is blow-back they're now reeling in . Maybe the best cover story for any top secret research was in 1947 in Roswell NM . What if the truth was told then but no one has accepted it . Operation Mogul . The story died away until 1980 . Roswell is a hoax - there never was a UFO crash there . The UFO industry around Roswell is an actively promoted psy-op to corral the herd into a fantasy safe-space away from the real events , which are nowhere near Roswell . This farce soaks-up time to prevent facts being discovered . I know . But the term flying saucer had just hit the public imagination in June 1947 . Now 72 years later there has never been another crash . So if the start of all of this is a lie still being perpetrated what does that say ? If a crash happened in China , why would China tell the world ? Therefore , a crash in china would remain secret . Thus , to say ' there has never been another crash ' is not a statement we have any evidence for , knowing that crashes would be classified . Why , then , was Roswell leaked ? Too many witness to deny something happened . That ’ s the problem with crashes witnesses No one saw jack at Roswell . I'll leap into a volcano like Empedocles if there is a scintilla of truth to Roswell .

"Racism is such a nasty infection , and unfortunately , it's found on both sides of the aisle , even by those who think they are calling it out . We shouldn't turn a blind eye , but at the same time , we should be careful in what we call racist . #racism #racistI've been called #racist because of something seemingly innocent I've said , but because I'm white I'm judged for saying those things . Or a look I give someone . But if I direct that expression to a white person , I'm no longer racist . I think I see a double standard . #racismThere was an incident in high school with a foreign exchange student from Germany ( if memory serves ) . I don't remember exactly what I said , but it wasn't something to the effect of ... "" Did you write it down ? "" I gestured like I was holding a pen writing something . That is ridiculous . I'm white and not racist . And I happen to be related to some Olympic-level racists . Unless that is just considered a rude gesture in another country I don't get it . If it was considered racist or offensive , ignorance of that fact does not equal racist . Racism is the thought that one race is better than another based on the virtue of them being different . Behaving in a racist way includes : telling racist jokes , using slurs in a derogatory way , treating somebody of a race poorly or differently only because of their race . There's nothing wrong with that definition except in how's it applied . If I'm standing in a group of black guys . One tells a racist joke about black people . Everyone laughs , including me . They aren't racist , but I am . That's the double standard . Perhaps I didn't find it funny ... Right , the double standard is always a fun one to talk around . That's part of how intent defines it . They were arguably in that situation laughing at the stereotype not the content of the joke in a belittling way . Granted , I've never been called racist at all ... Recently I saw a writer called out for describign a POC character's eyes as exotic . Definition : originating in or characteristic of a distant foreign country . That word alone is now considered racist . But only if the writer is white , AKA preestablished intent . See , I'd never see that as racist . If the writer in their narration passage called a POC character a slur , Idc what color the writer is , that to me is racist . Using "" exotic "" as in "" not of my homeland "" seems like just following the dictionary definition . As I mentioned in the rest of my thread , a slur can also be unintentional . A writer may do their research , but they can't help the reactions of trigger happy people who like to call everything racist . It's often the color of the writer who is mostly on trial , not the words . The word spelled : T-R-A-P is considered a cosplaying slur . I learned because of an angry outburst screaming over me & not hearing me ask what the PC term is . I meant to refer to a character type . Not to demean people . Words identify things . I still don't know the PC word ."," The fact that you are asking makes you racist . The fact that you even use the word "" about others "" makes you racist .

She sux  politics",  She only helped Biden last night since Iowa tends to punish petty desperate looking beefs . Might help Bernie but for SURE helps Biden ! Genius move Warren ! !,0

"   This is how it affects middle NZ , essentially . The key factor , though , is that those earning 100,000 plus aren't remotely impacted - these taxes hurt the bottom end . It's a hate tax on low income workers . Which is why both Nats & Labour ( every party , in fact ) are fine with it .   thats bs . The ones on 100k + pay double the tax and donate WAY more ... you are sadly deluded . Thats a scarcity and jealous mentality showing The arguement should be why do the govt waste so much money . What we earn should be what we keep in the majority no matter what you earn   Correct , the more you earn the more you ’ re taxed , over 100k earners are taxed at an unfair rate of 33 % which takes a huge chunk of your salary .   Sorry earning over 70k is taxed at 33 % so if you ’ re just over 70k you ’ re better off earning in the 60s because your tax rate is only 10.5 % so your take home is higher   60s is 30 % i think . 48g up . 48g is SFA , so that's stupid high . Coalition should've moved brackets , but they're tax-mad scum .   Yes 48k to 70k is 30 % which should be lowered to 17 % 70k & over is 33 % which it should be raised to people earning over 150 to 33 % 70 to 100k should be 17 % as well   why should people earning more pay a higher bracket , they are naturally going to contribute more anyhow ? How is that fair ? Thats greedy ...   Look at govt spending , as percentages . It's a simple subsidisation process , kept in motion by valued lobbyists . Revenue take & spend is published regularly . Do your research & pluck out what suits your narrative , as everyone else does .

" While I'm glad a good guy with a gun stopped him from slaughtering that congregation , two men whose lives mattered were slaughtered because the bad guy had a gun to begin with . Guns are a problem .  Two points : 1 ) You can't eliminate guns . 2 ) The killer can kill without a gun ( Arson , vehicular homicide , and many more ways to do so ) , but it's a lot harder to stop them without one .   Right . And men with guns stopped him . If you take away all the guns from the scenario , he could use another weapon to kill people , but the people would have no effective means to fight back .   So a knife has a faster kill rate than an AR or shotgun ? I'd rather take my chances against the knife . This old trope of an argument is spoon fed NRA garbage .   No , but a vehicle does . And what's the best way to stop a madman with a vehicle ? That's right , a gun . What you're saying is that you'd rather be disarmed completely , and hope killers use ineffective ways to kill people , than have the opportunity to defend yourself effectively .   I'm saying that the argument of gun control leaves guns with criminals , or they will kill somehow anyway so may as well be a gun , are tired overused propaganda from the NRA . No one is going to take all the guns . Believing they'll try is idiotic . Common sense control is a must .   But every proposal affects only the law-abiding , and does next to nothing to stop criminals . Universal background checks ? Long waiting periods ? Criminals can still steal guns or buy them on the black market . "" Assault weapon "" bans ? Ineffective at saving lives . What's your idea ?   And what we're doing now is saving lives and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals ? ?   Yes , violent crime is trending downwards . But I agree that more should be done to stop dangerous people . Widespread education on safe storage of firearms and the importance of theft prevention would be helpful . But people don't want gun education in schools .   We could allow the general public to access the NICS background check system so they can verify who they're selling a gun to without paying a gun dealer to run the check for them . But nobody has proposed that .   It depends on the dealer . Around me , it's usually around $ 25-30 . Add in the time and hassle of butter and seller finding a gun store that's open at a time convenient to both , and an unfortunate number of people might just say "" Eh , I'm sure you're fine "" and selling the gun .   Then it would be an illegal sale if 100 % background checks become law .   It's an illegal sale anyways , because it's illegal for a criminal to buy guns . That's why they steal them ( which is illegal ) , or use straw purchasers ( which is also illegal ) . You could pass 100 % background check laws , but it will only affect people who obey the law anyway .   It would flag people with mental health issues , domestic violence arrests , etc .    It could , but it could fail , too . Especially when people just don't obey the law . That's why I prefer giving people other than gun dealers access to NICS checks . It's not a burden on the law-abiding , but it will give them the ability to avoid selling to anyone who is prohibited . The Aurora , Illinois shooter was a prohibited possessor , yet he was abled to buy a gun at a store because NICS failed . Also , the vast majority of criminals obtained their guns through theft or the black market .  Last night my wife's car failed to start and she called be for help . I told her that if it failed once , then it's useless . Don't try and fix it . Don't even buy another one , because if one car fails then all cars are worthless , or at least I WOULD HAVE said that if I were INSANE .",  I'm sure your choice to post a gif from the movie that defines your life had nothing to do with your INABILITY to explain how a single failure in a system is justification for discarding the whole system .,0

"1 ) W / benefit of time to digest , please find here my thread on #ICC #OTP jurisdictional request re #Palestine & Twitter response . Sorry ,   & less so  ... some serious pushback on its way ! 2 ) Time to get on my hobby horse and say that the online responses to this filing again demonstrates how the #ICL court practitioner viewpoint is so underrepresented not only on Twitter , but the #ICL #ICC advocacy / policy / diplomatic / commentary community writ large .3 ) For those who are #ICL litigators , the wisdom & ethnics of Fatou Bensouda's filing is manifest . While Patryk alluded to it , he gave it far too little weight . There may be a difference of opinion , but OTP's move was by far the wiser .4 ) It would be ethnically & professionally reprehensible for OTP to go forward w / investigation , talk to witnesses & victims ( raise their exposure / protection issues ) , utilize staff time from not only OTP but other offices ( $ ) , spend large sums of money on the investigation itself , ...5 ) ... have to manage expectations that will undoubtedly soar no matter what , and deal w / a myriad of challenging cooperation and related complications , all for the case to collapse years later on jurisdictional issues that could have been resolved years prior .6 ) It is not hard to imagine the incredible backlash that would come in such a scenario ; a misstep that the #Israel / #Palestine issue / lobbies would use to eat the #ICC alive . The Court must act prudently , ethically , & professionally to navigate this terrain successfully .7 ) To wait on this jurisdictional issue at a later juncture ( likely much later too ) has so many potential pitfalls , as described above , and would play right into the hands of realpolitik hardliners , or states wanting an "" out "" .8) Need for significant pushback on Kevin's & Patryk's threads where they insinuate ( if not outright say ) that the jurisdictional issue is best determined at a later stage when the proverbial train has already left the station . I question whether these were serious points .9 ) If we analyze this closely ( & open to me misinterpreting your comments ) , it is to say that an uber tricky legal & political issue should be decided by the fact that resources & time has already been spent , so no good reason to stop now . What ? ! ?10 ) This issue should be decided by the letter of the law , not the expenditure of time , resources , and the like . If the Ct rejects jurisdiction & it is upheld on appeal , then so be it . We cannot manipulate ( diff from strategy ) the system to get the result we want / think it should be . Notice here how Kip describes complying with the Rome Statute as “ manipulating the system . ” As Patryk and I both pointed out , the Rome Statute does * not * require the OTP to adjudicate jurisdiction at this point . Major mischaracterization . Not saying “ it ” is a manipulation , but the reasons given for litigating later appear to be manipulation of the situation . Not mischaractizing anything . You said that , “ diff [ erent ] from strategy , ” waiting until later to litigate jurisdiction would “ manipulate the system . ” Show me where the law says the OTP has to do it now . Again , you conveniently leave out the reasons given to litigate later ( ie the train has left the station and that pressure will decide the matter ) . That is manipulating the system . I see . So complying with the rules in a manner that maximises your chances of success is “ manipulating the system . ” And I ’ m the one that doesn ’ t understand the practitioner ’ s perspective ! You have defined success here as only having one outcome . Maybe it could occur to you that the OTP is investigating the matter fairly and evenly , and don ’ t want to do so if outside the Court ’ s jurisdiction . Yes , I have defined success as a practitioner would — achieving one's litigation goal , which here is to investigate the Palestine situation . Your definition is fine if you ’ re working for an NGO , but lawyers want to win - - and ethical ones want to win within the rules . Again , define winning in terms of an INVESTIGATION , which this is . Yes , litigation of actual cases is where parties have clear goals of what is winning and losing . Not here . Further , you cannot be arguing that OTP defines winning as investigating in a situation where jurisdiction is lacking . So I am clear : I am not saying they don ’ t have jurisdiction . OTP effort is to better safe than sorry , a wise move when dealing w / Israel #Palestine issue", PS : I ’ m sure Israel and the US will be much more likely to cooperate with the Court now that the OTP has sought a jurisdictional ruling that will almost certainly go against Israel .,0

"It's not that the world is broken . It's that people are distracted from their lives by the images of their lives . Their parents were dream addicts too . We have made culture more important than biology , felling forests to build churches , turning teenagers into desk clerks . Why ?The answer is simple : we have confused the human desire for transcendence with money . The Protestant work ethic says that those who God has favoured will be materially successful . Financial enlightenment is billionaire status : transcendent level of the work ethic . It's a logical but unexamined conclusion : if god likes you a bit , you are rich . If he loves you a whole whole lot , you have billions . Transcendental wealth is the desire to experience god in money . No god yet ? Better try making some more money . Searching for infinity in coin .Making money as a spiritual practice is the unholy hybridisation of the Protestant Work Ethic and New Age movement . The search for enlightenment and the search for billions have unified in the western environment . But money is finite , and god is not . The money path never ends .We have to separate the urge to make money from the urge to know god . Money is finite and is used for finite , satisfiable goals in the material world . The impulse towards transcendence cannot be pointed at physical things without disastrous results . Light within . Work without .Consider this image . It exists to portray a certain kind of man at the peak of his aliveness . It is , in essence , a religious image . We all know this stuff . We know people paint the face of god on products to sell them . The question is , why does it work on us , even when we know ? The answer is that our brains are so primitive that we VERY SLIGHTLY think these images are real . We evolved in an environment without cameras and printers . Why would we have evolved defenses to being programmed by image to do what is bad for us ? Advertising is brain hacking . Memes really are dangerous , and the worst of them are so fundamenral they have overcome our biological needs : "" language is a virus . "" An entire wing of our civilization is dedicated to stealing your resources through brain subversion . Make a list of the people who profit from it Wrong .

"This is Oleksandr Kondrashov . An Yanukovich era tax evader , self imposed fugitive . He's now famous in Germany . If not around Germany then at least in Bavaria . And if not in Bavaria then definitely in Bad Kissingen , a spa town . In 2017 Ukraine issued a warrant on Oleksandr Kondrashov . This is Kay Blankenburg , oberbürgmeister of Bad Kissingen . He just signed a contract with sport maecenas to rent out local historic spa which budget heavily in disprofit . Kay is now in the hearts & mind of Ukrainians with his statement : "" The origin of the money is irrelevant "" . This is the spa in Bad Kissingen the oberbürgmeister sold to a "" investor from Ukraine "" for € 230000 . The catch with the deal laid in the fact Bavarian pays heavy subsidies to local municipalities who get rid of unprofitable historic venues . After signing the contact Oleksandr Kondrashov was eager to give interviews and share the optimism of Bad Kissingen residents of bright future of the spa . Also he promised major international sports competition to the spa town . He appointed himself to the managed of the company that bought the spa . He also was the head of a company which was in charge of maintaining Oleksandr Kondrashov estate in northern Germany . Most importantly during the interviews he always reminded those great foreign competition for UNESCO worthy spa town can come ( only ) when they , German local municipality , will help him to get German living permit . For permit one has to be employed . The German Dream lasted for several weeks . Then Oleksandr Kondrashov took the matter to his own hands and closed down the historic SPA as the owner kicking out all the clubs from the ice rink there , including the city's famous ice hockey club . The shock was unbearable for the Germans as Bad Kissingen had to compete for Bad Kissingen cup in another city ice rink . Kids and their parents protested against such barbarity on the streets . They even had banners in Ukrainian demanding reopening . In reality he bought the unprofitable spa to have another company where he's a director to force several German officials to support his pleas to get living permit in Germany . That was the sole reason he made that move . The words of oberbürgmeister : "" The origin of the money is irrelevant "" has all the potential to become a meme among Ukrainians . In fact it actually has been . German authorities arrested Oleksandr Kondrashov and he's in prison awaiting his possible extradition to Ukraine . He's a former Rada MP who made his wealth by swindling with gas transit money . ",I'm just full of tears after writing about this tragic story !,0

" The first commandment warns to not to create false gods in your head , which is very common . In the Bible a capitol G in God is the true God . A small g in god is an idol to be turned away from . gods = false idols . It says gods . It does not say false gods . A small "" g "" in the Bible means false gods . A capitol "" G "" in the Bible means the true God . Can you point me to where it says a small g means false gods ?

You can deny truth all you want . You have been doing that for years . Now it is clearly exposed . Shall we ask an expert ? I'm sure  can elaborate on the first commandment . There have been thousands of years worth of experts that understand this simple truth .   And how did they conclude the bible says something else than what it says ?  We now know that many of the Canaanite Gods are also in the OT and that those myths are the foundation of OT  False gods abound in the old testament and were condemned by God every time .  Again , they were never called false . And YHVH was an Eloha of the Elohim Read Job a …   Again , you are literally creating a god in your imagination and then fighting against him .  Please note , I * LOVE * the OT and continue to study it In it's original tongue And I lecture here on it .  If you don't understand that the gods ( small "" g "" ) of the OT are an abomination to God then stop lecturing .  They were only an abomination concerning the Jews YHVH had no issues with gentiles doing that  God is insulted by all idol worship .

The party / culture got more diverse and more liberal .America's history is that each Reconstruction era incites a fierce backlash . The first was violent , the second attacked the FDR & LBJ eras .The third produced Trumpism : which is only partly about economics ( note that the poorest white voters chose Clinton , not Trump ) .Trumpism is about what every Reconstruction backlash is about : restoring cultural norms that the majority finds comforting and empowering .So what are Democrats preparing to do in response ? The same thing they did before : pander to conservative white voters and spurn their base .Why ?

For weeks , Pelosi dragged her feet , refusing to send the Articles over to the Senate .The reason is that the Articles fail to meet the constitutional standard for impeachment . They do not allege a single crime was committed – not even a speeding ticket .  Yeah that's why #Trump was caught with Bribery and making up an executive Privillege . #TedCruz deals in #CORRUPTION  Said tge #Idiot with a hidden identity . Get to the back of the bus .

"Why would God make women so damn attractive if he didn ’ t want me to be a lesbian ?  Why would God say in the bible ( Old and New Testament ) homosexuality is a sin if it wasn't ?  Why would the Bible say a man can murder his daughter if she sleeps with somebody or is pregnant out of wedlock , if he can ’ t ?

"Some fundamental questions that determine outlook on life and hope : 1 . Do you think most people are basically good ? 2 . Do you think love conquers hate in the long run . 3 . Do you believe we can change the world by small acts of kindness and compassion ? My answer to all 3 is yes . Yes to all 3 . 🙂 I still believe most people are basically good & loves conquers all .

"A participant reveals Katy Perry's label held focus groups of ages 21-35 in attempt to figure out why she's “ no longer one of the most notable female pop artists . ” The label asked the groups for advice on what to do with her image and marketing to make them care about her again .   They ’ re just preparing for KP5 . And obviously she ’ s not the top female pop star anymore ... she ’ s been around for 12 years . No one stays at the top for that long .   Ummmm Mariah Carey just scored a #No . 1 song 25 + years into her career ... but she ’ s only good for a throwback right ? 🤣 🤷 🏻 ‍ ♀ ️    Obviously a song that made 90million + alone , is successful every year for 25 years in a row and reaches #No . 1 is not a Throwback but a CLASSIC . 🤷 🏻 ‍ ♀ ️ 👑   Girl it's successful because it's a Xmas song and the only song people can name from her . That's a throwback   I don't think you know what a throwback is . A song that comes every year to top the BB100 is a CLASSIC . Katy is a throwback - one that is casually remembered from time to time . Her former glory . But now is nothing but a memory .   There are many things wrong with this statement lmfao . AIWFC defines throwback and this year was the first time it “ topped ” the chart . Second , Katy isn ’ t a throwback . Sure , some of her biggest hits are , but she ’ s already proved with NRO that she is capable of new success .   1 . It's not a statement 2 . A year before this she chartted at 3 and before it at 10 - WITHOUT ANY PROMO - That song had been climbing the charts since 2012 . A song that successful without any actions from the artist is a CLASSIC 3 . Katy has not yet proven "" new success "" She a #tb   4 . Her christmas song which was released this year didn't even made any noise . It felt like a paraphrased AIWFCIY song but less festive . Furthermore , I think you should stop dissing AIWFCIY . It's what your fave wants for themselves . Thank you   Katy ’ s Christmas song was released LAST YEAR and charted at #50 despite being an AMAZON EXCLUSIVE . And again , NRO outcharted any Mariah song in the past decade . None of her new songs could dream of being hits . I didn ’ t diss AIWFC — I called it what it is : a throwback . Pressed .   Lmao last year , and still didn't even made any noise . Recycled lyrics . And you keep repeating NRO but I never heard that "" thing "" don't know if it's an album or a song . And tbh , Mariah releases albums no longer to chart but for her fans . She's not even promoting that hard . ( 1/2 )   NRO was Katy Perry ’ s 2019 single — Never Really Over . It was a top 15 Billboard hit with no promotion and no live performances . It ’ s actually one of her best and I recommend listening to it .","   Lmao , is that what you've been praising for . That song charted at 15 , as same as Mariah's which never really gotten any promo due to Mariah's accident . Plus , this is only KP's second decade in the industry ( quite dreadful if you ask me ) ( 1/2 )",1

An entity never mentioned in all the years of Rangers Football club from 1872 - 2012 . Strange that . Then it appears magically after liquidation .   Ah the backup has arrived , the holding company scenario appeared well before the any liquidation was started , know the facts pal .   The one thing that legally proves the football club didn't survive was the players walking free from the dead football club .   Lmao how wrong you are , they walked due to tupe rules on transfer of contracts between companies after a buy out , know the facts pal .   Tupe is there to protect the players contracts and wages . Every player could have transferred their contracts to Sevco and Sevco would have been legally obliged to offer the players exactly the same contracts that they had at Rangers . Most players chose to walk away instead .   And it was their choice to do so or not , they had to agree to the transfer between companies , clever bhoy .   Correct , the club that they were contracted to died , they chose to walk away .   Yawnfest , if Rangers had died there wouldn't have been any need for tupe to advise the players dumb dumb .

"It's widely known  has MJ and Bobby Brown as major influences . But you can also feel the aura of the likes of Prince & James Brown in Usher's art . So my top 3 favorite Usher's songs influenced by Prince : - Mars vs Venus - Do it to me - Lay you down   People are so dumb they want artists that are gonna straight up imitate Prince's voice & technique . What I love abt Usher is that he makes the song his own nd performs it to the best of his ability  Often , artists influenced by Prince don't want to be copycats because Prince himself was an innovator . Therefore , his followers make his sound their own in order to create something new : D'Angelo whole career or JT's FSLS album . It's the same with UR when he channels Prince .  It's like how people are complaining about Bilal &  not being included in the line-up   Maybe in their minds people who mimic Prince and profess loudly their love for him will automatically do good performances . Or they want the 2008 BET Prince tribute all over again ... Anyway , we don't know if other artists will be added . Also , these singers can be unavailable .",   Usher puts respect on other artists song whenever he does tributes,1

"I want to share one of my favourite song . 🤗 I first heard this song when I was about 13 years old & it's forever imprinted in my heart . Just watching the MV itself was both shocking & encouraging for the young me back then . #ChristinaAguilera Growing up in a rural area in an Asian country , many "" ideas "" presented in this MV was unthinkable for me at that time yet it was surprisingly easy for me to accept . It was also around this age when I realized I'm relatively more open & my thinking different from others around me .I guess my depression already started though back then I wasn't really aware , thought that harming myself to feel better is normal / OK . But this song's lyrics & video really left a mark on me . What about "" flaws "" ? What about "" differences "" ? There's so many out there , I am not alone .Even the starting lyrics ' are powerful . "" Everyday is so wonderful Then suddenly It's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed "" This . Even now , I still don't know why I'm like this . I'm just suffering . #ChristinaAguilera",""" I am beautiful No matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful In every single way Yes words can't bring me down So don't you bring me down today "" It's what I'm desperately struggling to coax myself with every single day . #ChristinaAguilera",1

"I ’ m confused as to how you can be in this industry and still be married / have a serious relationship . If it ’ s because you ’ re a super sexual person and need that fix , I get it . But I don ’ t understand the math behind being married AND working as a sw for the $ . So to fit traditional gender roles - and there's nothing wrong with liking those - should every woman quit working after marriage ? Or just sex workers ? Personally , I'd be uncomfortable being completely financially dependent on one person - unless I have a prenup in my favour 😇  Lol honestly either way . I don't want to be relying on "" pocket money "" . It's called love , Regina . Have you heard of it ? That's why sex workers get married . Why should anyone quit working when they marry ? How privileged .","  Also , the type of guy who wants his woman to give up work ( whether SW or not ) is also usually the type of guy who values his partner as a trophy ( and why not , when he paid dearly ? ) that he will trade in for the younger , tighter model as soon as he feels like it #commitment",1

"The job action will be the fourth held by the Ontario Secondary School Teachers ' Federation in an attempt to ramp pressure on the provincial government during contract talks .  Weird when they had two weeks to protest while students wouldn't be hurt they chose to spend it on vacation . But now the students are back , it's a good time to strike . You know , for the kids .  Weird that the government had all summer to show up at the bargaining table but they were on shut down . The cuts they are making hurt kids far more than one day rotating strikes !",  So its vendictiveness why teachers sat out the last 2 weeks rather than fighting .

"* huff , puff * Greetings , everyone ! Welcome to #SlateSpeak , your weekly progressive Christian chat . However , all are welcome , regardless of religion , or lack thereof . I am your host , and sorry I'm late . ( I was watching #JeopardyGOAT . ) ...... #SlateSpeak We don't always agree with other or the host , and that is ok : this is a safe place . We just ask you to please not troll . Now , for intros : name , pronouns , and one thing you hope for in the upcoming decade ( to do or to become ) ...#SlateSpeak ... while the intros are coming in , I'll start with prayer , but first note that my intro question is tied to our theme tonight : Lord God , thank you for bringing us to a new year and a new decade ! We ask for your guidance tonight ...#SlateSpeak ... and that we may be your instruments for peace and justice in the world . ( * now , please , conclude this prayer how you conclude it : I like to say , "" In Jesus ' name "" , but please say what you'd like ) Amen !#SlateSpeak ... Happy New Year , everyone ; I hope 2020 is going well in your personal lives , even if it got to a rough start . Not only is it a new year , but a new decade , and this brings us to our topic : new beginnings ! ...#SlateSpeak ... A smart aleck can dismiss this year / day as like any other and arbirary . However , rituals give space for expressing various emotions . For a new year , and particularly a new decade , it reflects our longings for new beginnings and for taking inventory ...#SlateSpeak ... I will follow  and start with scripture and say that God was , is , and is to come . ( Rev 4:8 ) Q1 : How do you see this verse tied to our theme ?#SlateSpeak ... Now , to the next question : Q2 : Which other scriptures do you see as tied to the theme of new beginnings , looking towards our future , etc . ?#SlateSpeak ... I think I'll go onto the next question : someone quoted "" In the beginning "" . I heard on a Jewish podcast that the verse can be read in Hebrew as "" With a beginning "" , meaning we can always have a new beginning ...#SlateSpeak ...

"I want to share one of my favourite song . 🤗 I first heard this song when I was about 13 years old & it's forever imprinted in my heart . Just watching the MV itself was both shocking & encouraging for the young me back then . #ChristinaAguilera Growing up in a rural area in an Asian country , many "" ideas "" presented in this MV was unthinkable for me at that time yet it was surprisingly easy for me to accept . It was also around this age when I realized I'm relatively more open & my thinking different from others around me .I guess my depression already started though back then I wasn't really aware , thought that harming myself to feel better is normal / OK . But this song's lyrics & video really left a mark on me . What about "" flaws "" ? What about "" differences "" ? There's so many out there , I am not alone .Even the starting lyrics ' are powerful . "" Everyday is so wonderful Then suddenly It's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed "" This . Even now , I still don't know why I'm like this . I'm just suffering . #ChristinaAguilera"" I am beautiful No matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful In every single way Yes words can't bring me down So don't you bring me down today "" It's what I'm desperately struggling to coax myself with every single day . #ChristinaAguilera"" To all your friends you're delirious So consumed In all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone Left the puzzle undone Ain't that the way it is "" What else can I say ? It always feel wrong . I always feel alone , incomplete #ChristinaAguilera","Whenever I feel stifled and frustrated , listening to this song usually allow me to cry myself to sleep . It's a much better option than hurting myself or keeping my tears in & pretending to be fine . #ChristinaAguilera",1

"🔔 We're proud to launch this new initiative , calling on churches across Britain to mark the first morning of our independence with the sound of bells ringing . Just as we did upon news of the Allies ' victory in 1945 , let's celebrate our new-found independence ! Find out more ⬇ ️ the church of england is so left wing and politically correct today that there is more chance they would ring their bells to pay respects to a dead terrorist than to support an important national occasion like Brexit .  If you think the CofE is left wing , you're in for a shock when you meet its founder ... ( Jesus , in case you thought I meant Henry VIII ... )    What nonsense . Church of England was founded by Henry VIII because Pope wouldn ’ t grant him divorce . Re-writing history is totalitarian . The whole organisation is based on hypocrisy . To say otherwise is blatant denial of the truth .   John Every system and every model of behavioral governance is a human construct And every human has hypocrisy as a character trait Your glass house is missing a few windows ...   Eh ? You know nothing of my beliefs . Are you denying Henry didn't start his own church because RC church wouldn't grant him a divorce ? & make himself & his heirs & survivors head of that church , a role present monarch fills ? History books I've read wrong then ?   The original tweet was about Jesus . We won ’ t worship Henry VIII . Your point is not relevant .   But Jesus didn't start Church of England . In fact Jesus didn't start any church , it was his disciples & followers . His fans in other words .   The church is simply a body of people who follow Christ . The fact the the CofE came about through a historical figure doesn ’ t change the core beliefs or validity .   But the whole concept of it as a separate entity was founded on Henry 8 not getting divorce from Pope . It is a hypocritical sham . Sorry but I think all religions are childish & are responsible for millions of deaths thru the ages , especially 20h century .","   Wouldn ’ t you say that about all human activity ? Human greed and revenge has caused far more death . The CofE may have been founded by Henry VIII , but that doesn ’ t mean we do anything else than try to follow Christ .

"New Beginnings can be made manifest in all areas of one ’ s life when we engage the word of God . The power to transform is in the word of God . #AThread To have a new beginning we need to think about it from the point of a new life , for us to have a new life we must have new thinking because change starts from within . How do you change from within and recognize critical conjunctures in destiny ? -- You have to see it from the standpoint of the supernatural . Change – a real makeover – starts from within – it is important for us to know that our internal structure ( what we want to change ) is formed through nature and nurture -– they are products of both our genetic code ( DNA ) and our environment . We can ’ t do anything about our DNA , what we have been through , where we grew up and whatever influence came from there but when there is a working of the spirit from within , our internal structure can change- From birth different forces try to determine your internal composition . Thought patterns , Belief systems , Attitude – What you meditate on internally is what would manifest externally -- Diet – what are you ingesting – what is being said or modeled to you ? What enters your heart that you accept ? What are you repulsed by that you reject ? Emotions – feeling fearful , depressed and overwhelmed will affect the way you live Can we really change ? -- We can ’ t change our DNA but if we can allow the holy spirit to work in our lives those things will no longer affect our decision in life . It can change our lives , and we can fulfill our destiny – this is internal makeover . -- There are trends that we grow up around but our lives will not align with those trends because there is an internal makeover that has been engineered by the spirit of God . How do you engineer an internal change that can lead to a new life ? -- Renew your mind - renewed mind has the ability to do great things - renew with the word of God Deal with Strongholds , Imaginations , Thoughts and Arguments through God ’ s word . Things that resists God ’ s will and plan can be dealt with through the word . -",Expose yourself to the right influence – make sure right influence is what is at work in your life – be exposed to the right things . . . . . #NewBeginnings #TimeForAMakeover #Life,1

"The Anglican position on infant baptism is unequivocally Augustinian : salvation is applied to ALL infants in baptism . Doesn't matter who you pull from , Cranmer , Parker , Jewell , Hooker , Ward , Andrewes , Davenant , Ussher , Overall ... you can go on for days .Of course , faith must be chosen later in life , but even then the baptism imparts grace that pulls one towards that faith .  Well , precise pinning down of election isn ’ t really a thing for classical Anglicanism . The BCP and Articles predate the Armenian / Calvinist debates .  Right , but now we are living past those debates so we need to be able to refine our language to dialogue with modern questions .  It ’ s like living after Nicea and being like “ well x church ’ s tradition predates the Arian controversy so they really don ’ t have a developed Trinitarian theology ”  Except that ’ s one is an issue of heresy and the other is an issue of intra-Reformed doctrinal precision . My argument is that such precision isn ’ t as necessary for our tradition as some would have it . As an Anglican I don ’ t have to choose between TULIP and Remonstrants .  Yeah the Nicean thing is an exaggerated example , but in light of Scripture don ’ t these questions have to be answered ?   I don't think post-reformation English church has a definitive position beside what is described in the 39 AOR / BOH anyways . Reformed & remonstrant coexist uncomfortably to this day   Nowell ’ s Catechism : M . What is the secret and spiritual grace [ of baptism ] ? S . Forgiveness of sins and regeneration ... By baptism we are received into the Church , and assured , that we are now children of God , and joined and grafted into the body of Christ , and become his members   A pretty clear disjunction from the Reformed teaching of ‘ covenant children ’   This is basically Calvin . The reality is annexed to the sign in the Genevan Catechism for ex   Calvin was basically not a Calvinist . He gave birth to a tradition that substantially rejected his theology , on the Eucharist , on baptism . He wasn ’ t a clear Dortian , or a Presbyterian . Didn ’ t teach covenant theology . He ’ s basically just “ a reformer ” without modern labels   "" Calvin was basically not a Calvinist "" is true and is , of course , the biggest take down of Calvinists .   Well , he would fit quite easily within the traditions of English Calvinism as it developed , for instance . But the harder stuff from Scotland and the Netherlands ... I mean , he didn't even like that in his own lifetime ...   Well , isn't that just the genius of the English and Irish churches in stopping later followers taking reformed doctrine too far ?   The part that's very strange is that the Welsh Calvinist tradition leans in that direction , despite the extreme oddness of its history .   Well , Calvinistic Methodism is just inherently so v odd .",   Very of my ancestors for coming up with a religious tradition specifically designed to make theologians cry .,1

"Good luck to everyone marching for independence in Glasgow today - hope the weather isn ’ t too bad ! Sorry I can ’ t be there today , but look forward to seeing you all again soon . In the meantime , sending my support and best wishes . I'm British . And unfortunately I am loosing my EU citizenship . I am seruously considering moving to Scotland in the next few years , so as to be able to stay near my admin and yet retain my EU citizenship rights . Do you think this will be a possibility ?  Independence doesn't mean Scotland staying in the EU . I'm afraid you've been misled .   Tells us why it would be beneficial for Scotland stay in the union ? I mean anything would be good ... 👂 ! ! ? ? ? !   The pooling and sharing of resources that means that when different parts of the UK do well , they can fund those parts doing less well , and ensure public services are maintained . In the 80s and early 90s Scotland was a net contributor , in the years since we have had net benefit .   London Docklands was unproductive wasteland in 1980s . Investments from rest of country resulted in development and is now massive contributor to UK revenues including to Scotland .   Total bollocks both of you . Scotland , like many regions of England has been starved of investment and any joined up economic planning . The only for Scotland to prosper is to take control of our own resources . Pooling and sharing is a myth .   Economic planning is devolved . You should complain to the SNP . Independence means losing billions of pounds a year . Pooling and sharing is very , very real and we'd find out the hard way if we dividing the UK as you want to .   Really ? The Scottish gov decided to invest billions in HS2 , London Crossrail , the Olympics development , Trident renewal , tax breaks for oil companies etc . Scotland is a wealthy country with enormous potential .   Too many myths ( HS2 , Crossrail , Olympics etc ) to bother with there . And infrastructure investment in any part of the economy benefits whole economy through added productivity .   Myths ? More nonsense . You don't think direct investment in Scotland on the scale there has been in SE England would be of greater benefit to the Scottish economy ?   As I've pointed out before the fiscal transfer is a myth . Even if it were true don't you think it would be a better idea to have an economic policy the whole country would benefit from ?   The whole country does benefit . That's what the map shows . Haven't you got a march to go to ?   So the whole country would benefit from investing in Scotland instead wouldn't it ? As for marches we can get tens of thousands to march on a terrible day like this the union can't get anyone except your pals in the OO to March in the middle of summer .   We don't organise marches . We don't want to change Scotland's place in the UK .",   2014 demonstrated the effectiveness of the wonderful democratic institution that is the secret ballot .

"Holy crap , this board ! I ’ d forgotten all about it , but today it surfaced while I was looking for something else . This is the first Feather I ever designed : a simple SAMD 11 board with mostly thru-hole components , because as of last summer I was still afraid of surface mount parts .   Fact : SMD is easier to solder than TH You don't need a microscope for 0805 and above  I made a mess of my first attempt . I can ; t understand how those small fiddly ( and very bridgeable ) legs are easier to solder ... then again ... I don't think I had the right kit for the job .  For me , a flux pen changed everything . With bridged pins you can add some flux and do kind of a sweeping motion with your iron away from the bridged spot ; seems to work like magic .   Flux is key for smd . Also if your iron can change tips , get a chisel tip or cut off cone type tip , the pointy tips are really awful for drag soldering ( a good term to google for some video tutorials , once you understand drag soldering , everything will be easy breezy )   I agree with everything has said , I just want to add I find the cut off cones type iron heads the easiest to use","   Thanks lads !

"1 . I ’ ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I ’ ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is “ razor thin ” .2 . In fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts : a ) A pattern of travel showing Suleimani was in Syria , Lebanon & Iraq to meet with Shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the US . ( As one source said that ’ s just “ business as usual ” for Suleimani )3 . More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader ’ s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything .4 . And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran ’ s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy .5 . But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap .6 . One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . 27 , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the “ far out option ”7 . Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : 8 . It was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one US official , chose the Suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that American intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . They scrambled to locate him , says the official .9 . According to the official , the strike on Suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the US was not sure PMF leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was in the convoy . He was also killed and is also viewed as an Iranian proxy : 10 . Since the strike , Iran has convened its national security chiefs . Chatter intercepted by American intelligence indicates they ’ re considering a range of options . Cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and American personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far .11 . But among the “ menu options ” that I had not heard before were : ( 1 ) kidnapping and execution of American citizens . ( This might explain why the State Department has ordered the evacuation of all US citizens in Iraq , not just government and embassy employees ) . 12 . Another is attacks on American diplomatic and military outposts not just in Iraq , Lebanon and Syria , but as far afield as UAE and Bahrain . The official I spoke to was particularly concerned for American troops stationed in Iraq , some of whom are co-located with Shia militias13 . How does this impact the war against ISIS ? I turned to  for insight . He ’ s studied Iraq since the 1990s . What he told me is that months before the strike that killed Suleimani , the tensions with Iran had already degraded America ’ s ability to fight ISIS in Iraq :14 . In 2019 , America has been denied airspace and access to operations in Iraq to go after ISIS at the behest of Iran-backed groups . The US has also been told to stop communicating with Sunni tribes . These are important setbacks that have already weakened the US ’ posture in Iraq15 . “ It ’ s all been downhill , ”  told me , in terms of America ’ s access to the ISIS battlespace in recent months due to Iranian pressure on Iraqi officials . One upshot ? US special operations forces have been on the offensive in Diyala , Nineveh and Kirkuk provinces16 . A likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out-of-the-way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . Fighting ISIS is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the US embassy is being attacked .17 . Before I go back to the pool let me just say the obvious : No one ’ s trying to downplay Suleimani ’ s crimes . The question is why now ? His whereabouts have been known before . His resume of killing-by-proxy is not a secret . Hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga .", Ahhh ! So Trump planned the mournful protesters at the US Embassy on New Year ’ s Eve !,1

.  : Grubhub CEO saying employees who agree Trump rhetoric should resign is setting himself up for a law …   I disagree . Why do you want those kind of people on your team . The CEO is right !  Good thing it wasn't done when Obama won 2 terms huh ? Losing such a huge base of US workers would sting a bit .  It all depends on how you view and understand the message . Whether Dem / Rep that should not be ppl behaviour  I viewed it as a threat as most did .,  Then the world is more sick than I thought .

"I freaking love this election . It's exposing our counterfeit gods and functional saviors for what they are . America , your idols are showing . But more importantly what do you feel about the outcome Alexis ? hey , Lewis ! How do you mean ? If I understand your question , I might say peace - peace that rests in the sovereignty of God . well , I still feel like that's a loaded question & I'm not entirely sure what u mean . Hosea 13:11 & Romans 1:24 come 2 mind . God expects us to exercise good judgement and act justly . This hasn't happened here . well Idk if He expects us 2 . I mean , He wants us 2 , but I also think He knows better . ;) But He remains gracious & faithful . He always prefers that we do the most loving thing . This is never in doubt . then praise God for the sufficiency of His grace for when we do not . His sovereignty is complete and His grace is enough . :) Alexis you must be living in another world . how do you figure ? Do you not believe God's grace is sufficient ? Alexis we have the ability and the responsibility to make peoples ' lives better . The nation has failed . No doubt . I think our responsibility goes beyond that to point people to Jesus . How does God factor into your conclusions ? then love Donald Trump , pray for him , love the people that voted for him , pray for them , love the people that didn't , etc . You're assuming I don't , but I can & must disagree vociferously with people & situations in such opposition to the Kingdom . sin is opposition to the Kingdom - we're all guilty of it , some more publicly than others . I'm saying let's love everyone . But we do have to oppose sin especially when it is so structural with such power to harm so many ."," I agree , even in our own lives - but what is our best weapon ?

It's important that we show President Trump & the republicans the same respect and cooperation that they showed President Obama . The sad part of all this is that Trump showed us that going high makes us feel good but is ultimately ineffective . it's not ineffective at all . Cynicism gets us nowhere . Not effective ? The GOP just gained more governmental power than they've had in almost 90 yrs . & they'r picking the new sc justice, the only thing we have to #fear is fear itself .,1

"Why would God make women so damn attractive if he didn ’ t want me to be a lesbian ?  Why would God say in the bible ( Old and New Testament ) homosexuality is a sin if it wasn't ?  Why would the Bible say a man can murder his daughter if she sleeps with somebody or is pregnant out of wedlock , if he can ’ t ? Modern day rules preventing fathers from killing their daughters are sinful .  If you really want to learn about God , start with researching the resurrection of Christ . If Christ rose from the dead , then no better reason to believe or to worship . If he didn't then Chris is a fraud .",  Billy Graham ’ s granddaughter said it best : God judges our entire existence based on how we love Him and how we love other people .

"🔔 We're proud to launch this new initiative , calling on churches across Britain to mark the first morning of our independence with the sound of bells ringing . Just as we did upon news of the Allies ' victory in 1945 , let's celebrate our new-found independence ! Find out more ⬇ ️ the church of england is so left wing and politically correct today that there is more chance they would ring their bells to pay respects to a dead terrorist than to support an important national occasion like Brexit .  If you think the CofE is left wing , you're in for a shock when you meet its founder ... ( Jesus , in case you thought I meant Henry VIII ... )    What nonsense . Church of England was founded by Henry VIII because Pope wouldn ’ t grant him divorce . Re-writing history is totalitarian . The whole organisation is based on hypocrisy . To say otherwise is blatant denial of the truth .   John Every system and every model of behavioral governance is a human construct And every human has hypocrisy as a character trait Your glass house is missing a few windows ...   Eh ? You know nothing of my beliefs . Are you denying Henry didn't start his own church because RC church wouldn't grant him a divorce ? & make himself & his heirs & survivors head of that church , a role present monarch fills ? History books I've read wrong then ?   The original tweet was about Jesus . We won ’ t worship Henry VIII . Your point is not relevant .   But Jesus didn't start Church of England . In fact Jesus didn't start any church , it was his disciples & followers . His fans in other words .   The church is simply a body of people who follow Christ . The fact the the CofE came about through a historical figure doesn ’ t change the core beliefs or validity .   But the whole concept of it as a separate entity was founded on Henry 8 not getting divorce from Pope . It is a hypocritical sham . Sorry but I think all religions are childish & are responsible for millions of deaths thru the ages , especially 20h century .","   Wouldn ’ t you say that about all human activity ? Human greed and revenge has caused far more death . The CofE may have been founded by Henry VIII , but that doesn ’ t mean we do anything else than try to follow Christ .

"cue the silly jibes against 4 - day Tests from the classicists , as if the date on a calendar & not the overs determine the state of the game . over rates are only going downhill , no way you are gonna be able to fit 98 overs in a day when teams sometimes barely reach 80 there's a big difference between a fixed 50 - over innings and 3 sessions daily for 5 days . Already cricket is so weather-affected esp . in subcont ctries . 5 days allows a buffer day when we lose several sessions . Irreversibly changing to 4 days will only lead to a lot of draws please explain this ' big difference ' , is it played with different equipment ? If there is a ' buffer day ' then why do 5 day Tests also get washed out ?  It is played with different equipment I . e the white ball which is good to play in not the best of light compared to a red ball and it makes a huge difference . The over rate is always lower than 15 which is the amount of overs bowled in a hour .  Lol color of the ball is all you got for the huge difference ? Ok dude .  It matters but you wouldn ’ t know since you ’ ve prob never played any real cricket . Ok dude .  awww seems like your feelings have been hurt , run along now .

""" Mammy's not well "" 5 year old Priya has FaceTimed her Dad , Damian , using the family iPad . Damian is on his way to work . It's been a busy few weeks for the family . His wife Mary , 35 , is at home with their daughter and new 2 week old baby , Noah . It's two days before Christmas .Horrified , Damian sees from the iPad that his daughter is holding , that his wife Mary has collapsed to the ground . She is not moving . She can't speak . He quickly calls family members who live next door . They race to the house , calling an ambulance along the way .An ambulance arrives . The paramedics suspect Mary has suffered a stroke . Within 15 minutes they are on the way to CUH . They pre-alert the Emergency Department and the CUH stroke team , who are waiting at the door as the ambulance arrives .Mary is seen immediately by the Emergency Medicine and Stroke Teams together . She has suffered a catastrophic stroke . She can't speak . She can't swallow . She can't see properly . She is paralysed down her right hand side .Advanced imaging shows that Mary has torn her left carotid artery , the main blood vessel bringing blood from her heart , through her neck to her brain . Worse still , she has also blocked the left middle cerebral artery - the main blood vessel with the brain itself . Mary is critically ill . There is no blood getting to the left hand side of her brain . At just 35 , this stroke will either kill her or leave her with severe disability , requiring nursing home care . The chances of her returning back home to her young family are no more than 5 % . But , Mary has come to CUH - the busiest inpatient stroke centre in Ireland and 1 of just 2 hospitals in the country , that can provide stroke thrombectomy - the ability to acutely remove the blood clot causing the stroke . Mary is immediately prepped for an emergency thrombectomy .Consultant Interventional NeuroRadiologists Dr . Gerry Wyse and Dr . Noel Fanning , along with their team , quickly rebuild Mary's torn carotid artery using 3 special stents . They then remove the blood clot further up in her brain . She has been in hospital less than 1 hour .Mary is transferred to the Stroke Unit under Consultant Neurologist , Dr . Aine Merwick . The team , and Mary's family wait to see if the procedure has been clinically successful . Within 24 hours , Mary can speak again . Within a few days she can wash and dress herself .Within a week , Mary has no discernible stroke deficits . She can walk and talk , eat and drink , laugh and cry . She leaves hospital a little over a week later , stopping on the way with her husband Damian , to again meet the team that saved her life . I was't directly involved in Mary's care but I am enormously proud of the skill and dedication of my colleagues here in CUH who were able to save her life . She came to our hospital , our stroke service , at the most critical time in her life and received emergency care that iscomparable to any hospital in the world . There hasn't been any clinical intervention in medicine within the last decade as effective as stroke thrombectomy . Uniquely , for medical advances , it is also hugely cost effective , with large reductions in rehab and social care costs .We have performed 77 thrombectomies in CUH in 2019 , a 50 % increase on previous years . We have treated patients from Cork , Kerry , Tipperary , Limerick , Waterford and Clare . We have had many outcomes as good as Mary's , albeit few as dramatic .We still have work to do to further develop CUH as a comprehensive stroke service with a properly equipped and staffed stroke unit that can provide comprehensive stroke care to the people of Cork and Munster , every hour of every day , every day of the year . We are making progress .Mary is back at home with her husband Damian and her now 5 week old son , Noah . Her daughter Priya is back playing on her iPad . ( An enormous thank you to Mary and her family for giving us permission to tell her story ) .", What an incredible about Mary so thrilled she is so well now . What amazing work you have all done in CUH a miracle expert team if professionals . Hats off to you all ! 🎉 🎉 #miraclescanhappen #care #dedication Wishing Mary & family a full and very happy life 💌 💌 💌,1

"9 years ago today , my #piano teacher died unexpectedly from post-pregnancy complications . It shook me up . #Death is never an easy thing . It took a few years for my love of piano to return . A new teacher was kind & patient , and taught me to love the piano again #MusicTeachers can inspire us to love #music . Both of these teachers will never understand how much I appreciated this gift It was only a few years ago that I felt like it was okay for me to grieve the death of my teacher . That grief let me heal I still get nervous when friends are pregnant ... and that unease doesn't let up until several weeks after the delivery . But time does help heal , and the whole experience gives me insight into what some other people are feeling and going through So wherever you are today , whatever is going on , whatever things frighten you ... just know that you're loved . #KeepGoing #hugs"," And also , it's okay to remember the ones we've lost .

"To battle depression , there's a list of things people recommend . 1 . Eat healthy 2 . Exercise 3 . Therapy 4 . Pills 5 . Get a good nights sleep 6 . Think more positively and the list goes on . Some of these things are easier said than done ( part 1 )Others are pretty much impossible when you're struggling to make ends meet , when your mom works 2 jobs and she's struggling to make ends meet . How can I eat healthy when I can't afford to eat ? How can I go to therapy when I can barely afford my meds ?And a good night's sleep on this mattress 🤣 . The system around beating depression only works if you have the money for it and if you don't well good luck , but no one wants to talk about that . #depressionfeelslike #depressedandpoor #SickNotWeak", No amount of Money can buy Joy Joy lives in one's heart Wish you Joy,1
"   I have already practiced other religions . I would still focus on the highest ideal in silent prayer / meditation , as I have always done since the beginning of my journey . Because it is beneficial and fail to see the benifit in not believing in a God or gods .   Sticking with facts and reason is actually good for your brain . You are a case in point . Lack of reason makes you loopy .   Do you think that is what becoming an atheist is ? I mean , sticking with the facts ? What is the benefit in not believing ?   So you ’ re believing because there ’ s benefits   I don't know why you do what you do , but my guess is because of the deep hatred you hold torwards others .   Just explained why it is beneficial for you to not believe .   No , you don't provided your opinion . Until you DEMONSTRATE it as valid , I don't accept it as valid . It's an honesty thing . You wouldn't understand .   I understand you honestly don't believe . My question is how is that beneficial for you and those around you ?   It is my intention to believe as many true things and as few false things as possible .   I keep hearing that what do you believe ?   I believe that most religions are centred on myths that are symbolic rather than explanatory .   Most religions are false . Christianity is the only faith where we worship the one true living God .   The followers of every god worshipping religion say that , why should we believe you ?","   The nature of GOD as He shows Himself to be : Holy , Creator , As the Word of the Living GOD goes forth ... so things are . #AbsoluteTruth from Eternal Omniscient is a firm foundation The living it out for us to know was accomplished by Messiah Jesus Christ & followers . lives",1

Hoping your Christmas was great , and wishing you a wonderful new year ’ s eve !   What is a typical New Years day like there , Seanna ?   I ’ m probably not the best person to ask Terri .

After living a year without alcohol , I realized I didn ’ t miss it . Have you ever been around people who have been drinking & you ’ re the only sober one ? It can be odd .   I like that as I ’ m able to recount the stories and the bits they ’ d rather forget 🤣 . I stopped because one of my meds made alcahol taste like copper . Been off the drink 16 years now .   I hear ya , Seanna . I can ’ t even remember how the taste was altered , but it was no longer enjoyable . I have to think it has positively impacted our grocery bill ?

"#ThursdayMotivation This world ’ s cultures and philosophies are constantly changing and adapting , while for thousands of years , God ’ s Word has never changed . Even Constitution changes but GOD changes not I choose to stand with God rather than with society !    It comes back , brother Eric , to that wonderful ex seeposé that Saint Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 18-24 . What the world regards as mere foolishness is precisely God's plan : to make human knowledge be unable to grasp the fundamentals of sprituality . And thereby remain defiant . YSNH   * expose * This predictive text makes a mockery of communication . YSNH   We will not be held accountable to my opinion or your opinion , but judged according to God's words   Hence my thought the other day : "" Always Scripturise ! "" Scripturising saves us from speaking of God's Word w / o its authority to back us & saves us from heresy . We can interpret as much as we like , but the Scripture is , will be N shall remain the bedrock of our discussions . YSNH   Christianity is not a bible verse tattooed on your arm . Christianity is not a cute Hillsong lyric . Christianity is not the one line in your Instagram bio . Christianity is actively dying to yourself and living for Christ . Salvation is the everyday experience in CHRIST ⛪ JESUS ",   May we ALL decide to experience #Christ #Jesus forever going forward by making the personal decision to take on His sincere heart ... His HEART of eternal for ALL ! Ezekiel 36:26 #PRAYER ,1
"It used to be a standard part of many peoples ’ lives . Have a glass of wine or two with dinner . Get together with friends and open up a bottle of wine . But in 2019 , for the first time in 25 years , wine drinking actually decreased . Why ?  #wine #wineoclock  A WSJ article two days ago attributed it to millenials preferring other new imbibes like alcoholic seltzer . Ugh ! Even amongst the older wine drinkers I know , they're drinking less . It's just a hassle to open an entire bottle of wine and know it's going to go bad quickly . The industry needs to update from the archaic 750ml model ."," Yeah , that's a concern of mine b / c I've drank wine since I was two years old ( Italians used to put it on the gums of teething babies ) but never in large quantities . i So maybe small bottles ? #wine #geography #viticulture",1
"   Scotland was incredibly rich in 2014 . We still are wealthy . I don't see your point   Not a Spanish btw . Well aware of EU rules   In which case you should know why theoretically , a #Scexit ravaged Scotland would struggle with meeting the criteria . “ Wealth ” - I presume is you refering to dwindling oil reserves and growing renewables . You allude ro SME so you know that is only part of the requirement .   I know that we currently meet all of the criteria because we are already a member , so our transition back into EU should be fast and easy , according to Jean Paul Junker . I ’ ll just take his word for it thanks   Junker has nothing to do with it , you don't meet the criteria on so many points , but you know that .   ah ok , where is Scotland's Central Bank ? , just one of the criteria that we don't meet .   Bulgaria , Croatia , Czech Republic , Denmark , Hungary , Poland , Romania , Sweden ( and UK ) don't use the euro .   and only Denmark and UK are legally allowed to remain outside of the euro permanently . This is by treaty negotiation and means that iScotland on joining has to agree to join the euro at some point in the future . A requirement is a central bank .   I'm sure well be fine the world doesn't revolve round your Brit pound , what if Scotland leaving the UK will impact the value of it .   Scotland leaving will have virtually no negative effect and potentially a positive one over time . The rUK retaining the additional funding that was paid to ScotGov will have a beneficial effect on rUK economy . Your mistake is thinking the Union is about money .   That's the mistake of the unionist . So let's hear what's more important .   Yes we often make mistakes quoting facts at you nationalists . Many have advised me that it's a waste of time and with your responses here I'm beginning to believe them .   Gers is the No1fact that's given to me fair enough , the problem is these figures are calculated within the union , these figures will change when Scotland is Indy Do you want Scotland to live with a deficit taking from the English economy the rest of its days . That's not good ➡ ️   GERS gives Scotland the figures on the last day of Union and first day of independence . From that day the accounts must be managed by SCotGov , this means expenditure must equal income . Would you raise tax by 20 % , cut public spending by 20 % or mix of both ?   Would you like some more time on this one Baz ?   A mix of both leaning more towards tax increases . We'll manage","   To be viable post #Scexit , Scotland would need an additional 500,000 taxpayers , which means attracting companies . As Scotland is already the highest taxed part of the UK , you propose further increasing the taxes which means business and immigrants won't come to Scotland",1
"I ’ m confused as to how you can be in this industry and still be married / have a serious relationship . If it ’ s because you ’ re a super sexual person and need that fix , I get it . But I don ’ t understand the math behind being married AND working as a sw for the $ . So to fit traditional gender roles - and there's nothing wrong with liking those - should every woman quit working after marriage ? Or just sex workers ? Personally , I'd be uncomfortable being completely financially dependent on one person - unless I have a prenup in my favour 😇  Lol honestly either way . I don't want to be relying on "" pocket money "" . It's called love , Regina . Have you heard of it ? That's why sex workers get married . Why should anyone quit working when they marry ? How privileged .","  Also , the type of guy who wants his woman to give up work ( whether SW or not ) is also usually the type of guy who values his partner as a trophy ( and why not , when he paid dearly ? ) that he will trade in for the younger , tighter model as soon as he feels like it #commitment",1

"Love wantintin 😍 Yeah , we know love is sweet , but do you want to know what is sweeter ? Being aware of the legal implications of marriage before you jump right into it . There are many legal implications of marriage that many people fail to consider . Let ’ s highlight some : Averagely , many people assume that a woman would take the last name of her husband once they get married . But should you always assume ? No ! ! Before you get married to your spouse , you need to talk about whether or not you are willing to change your name or if your spouse is willing to adopt your name . Don ’ t just assume , discuss this with your spouse first . ","Having a joint account / investment : Having a joint account or property isn ’ t , in itself , a bad thing . What is bad is when one person has the monopoly of such account or property ... Continue reading on #BellaNaijaFeatures . #marriage #law ",1

"Let me throw up something about the Shaheen Bagh protests . They ’ re costing me at least ₹ 75 and 30-60 minutes every working day .How you might ask ? With the DND clogged up , to be fair if I go to office early enough in the AM I can use the DND but in the evenings , I ’ m forced to use Nizamuddin . So on average I ’ m driving ten clicks more daily .Which in the car I ’ m driving right now is about a litre of petrol , so ₹ 75 . But you could argue that that much money wouldn ’ t hurt someone like me . Sure , I ’ m not happy about burning an extra litre of fuel , but on that front , I ’ m not one to talk .But I could without the time loss , but then again I ’ m in a nice car with an air purifier and a nice audio system . So more time for podcasts .But the average commuter isn ’ t as lucky as me . They ’ re spending hours more in some cases and much more money . And while ₹ 75 won ’ t hurt me , the average commuter who is affected does get hurt spending ₹ 100 more a day .So when you think of the tens of thousands of commuters affected , the extra money and fuel spent , the maths will not be pretty . You would be looking at tens of crores daily in pure financial costs , but the time wasted and the additional pollution ? Can you stick a monetary value ?"," Dude ... they don't care about the #minorities being killed , raped , converted in 3 islamic nations .

"" The missiles fired last night at us & our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration . "" President Obama in 2015 : "" Now , this is not to say that sanctions relief will provide no benefit to Iran ’ s military .

"#depressionfeelslike Hello everyone , the name is Ana , I ’ m 20 years old and I suffer from depression and anxiety . I am a very shy person so making friends is extremely hard for me , I ’ m alone most of the time and I don ’ t wanna be alone anymore , I want to go out , have fun ,talk to people , get dressed up , feel pretty , not worry what people think , but every time I think of doing it depression and anxiety come and tell me is better to stay in my bed , to stay alone , that nobody cares for me so why should I care for myself ,that I don ’ t need to where nice clothes if I ’ m not going anywhere , don ’ t need makeup because is to much work to put on and I ’ m gonna look ugly anyway . I can ’ t do this anymore , I want to change , I need help ,but in the current situation in my family we don ’ t have the money for the treatment and I feel like reaching a point where breathing is not necessary anymore . I need somebody to listen to me ."," Your true friend the source of Joy lives in your heart , connect with it Wish you Joy",1

I take my fried chicken seriously & hate it when people try to force me to eat the chicken they think I should eat . That will start a war in my house . LOL . Just like the man a woman chooses to date / marry - - chicken choices shouldn't be forced - - that's why I got away from the wise family members with control issues in those departments .

"In this life I find myself in now , post apocalypse , sometimes it's hard for me to feel loved . Knowing I am loved & believing it are different things .

I pray for the ability to believe & receive it on down days . 🙏It feels absurd to be so depressed about my life when I see all these miraculous changes happening in the world . I know it gets better , and I know I'm not alone . Far from it . But it is a strange , peculiar juxtaposition to feel alone in a crowded room .

"cue the silly jibes against 4 - day Tests from the classicists , as if the date on a calendar & not the overs determine the state of the game . over rates are only going downhill , no way you are gonna be able to fit 98 overs in a day when teams sometimes barely reach 80 there's a big difference between a fixed 50 - over innings and 3 sessions daily for 5 days . Already cricket is so weather-affected esp . in subcont ctries . 5 days allows a buffer day when we lose several sessions . Irreversibly changing to 4 days will only lead to a lot of draws please explain this ' big difference ' , is it played with different equipment ? If there is a ' buffer day ' then why do 5 day Tests also get washed out ?  It is played with different equipment I . e the white ball which is good to play in not the best of light compared to a red ball and it makes a huge difference . The over rate is always lower than 15 which is the amount of overs bowled in a hour .  Lol color of the ball is all you got for the huge difference ? Ok dude .  It matters but you wouldn ’ t know since you ’ ve prob never played any real cricket . Ok dude .  awww seems like your feelings have been hurt , run along now .

"   Why don't we just feed them ? He cares but he wants us to do it , we can sort starvation out in a heartbeat but the wickedness of man prevents it . Jesus could come and slap people in the face with a fish for being so stupid , a few weeks later , they'd go back to their wicked ways .   why doesn't the vatican do it ? because they are a hoax , they have self-invented themselves taking advantage of a myth , jesus , to dominate people and conquer territories to gain power and riches , that's the reality of it   I'm not a Catholic , so ask them . I know the good my church does .   I dunno mate , you tell me . Gather up a few atheists and ask them why they lie to themselves on a daily basis that God doesn't exist ?   We actually say that we dont believe in any gods which is the truth . You have a lot to learn before you can call us liars .   Have a look what the bible says about bearing false witness , it is a sin to call me a liar when I am not , I am only trying to save you from hell . Proverbs 6:16 - 19    I think you misunderstood his tweet . Look back at it   He said that I say to myself that god doesnt exist , I do not , hat is a deliberate lie , I say I dont believe that god exists , no one knows whether a god exists or not .   Isn ’ t saying to yourself that God doesn ’ t exist and saying you don ’ t believe that God exists , pretty much the same thing ?   No , I dont know whether god exists or not , nobody does , all I know is that I am unconvinced that he exists , therefore I dont believe . Just because I dont believe in god doesnt mean that he doesnt exist , just like you believing in him doesnt mean he does exist .   We can know GOD as much as we are able to know Him , in same way we can know anything . Examine Him . See what He says and does . See & hear & read testimonies from others . Most of all use Truth of what is known to be True to test whatever we absolutely know is True . > >   Bring god here and we'll examine him . Blathering on about god with no evidence that he even exists is not going to cut it .   That ’ s all .. he shows up and we ’ re all believers .. that simple .. instead of us all killing each other in his name , just show us you exist .. is that asking too much ?   Oh ? ! I see . I really do . You want to SEE , feel & Touch Jesus ? So do I ! It seems you will only accept Jesus as you WANT Him to be rather than how he really is . What do u know about who Jesus is ? #c4urself If you u to know Him , then honestly learning FROM Him is best .   Then why are you here ? Step aside . Let Jesus speak for himself .","   Why am I here ? Same reason someone else was here for me ... others as myself .

We just ask you to please not troll . Now , for intros : name , pronouns , and one thing you hope for in the upcoming decade ( to do or to become ) ...#SlateSpeak ... while the intros are coming in , I'll start with prayer , but first note that my intro question is tied to our theme tonight : Lord God , thank you for bringing us to a new year and a new decade ! We ask for your guidance tonight ...#SlateSpeak ... and that we may be your instruments for peace and justice in the world . ( * now , please , conclude this prayer how you conclude it : I like to say , "" In Jesus ' name "" , but please say what you'd like ) Amen !#SlateSpeak ... Happy New Year , everyone ; I hope 2020 is going well in your personal lives , even if it got to a rough start . Not only is it a new year , but a new decade , and this brings us to our topic : new beginnings ! ...#SlateSpeak ... A smart aleck can dismiss this year / day as like any other and arbirary . However , rituals give space for expressing various emotions . For a new year , and particularly a new decade , it reflects our longings for new beginnings and for taking inventory ...#SlateSpeak ... I will follow  and start with scripture and say that God was , is , and is to come . ( Rev 4:8 ) Q1 : How do you see this verse tied to our theme ?#SlateSpeak ... Now , to the next question : Q2 : Which other scriptures do you see as tied to the theme of new beginnings , looking towards our future , etc . ?#SlateSpeak ... I think I'll go onto the next question : someone quoted "" In the beginning "" . I heard on a Jewish podcast that the verse can be read in Hebrew as "" With a beginning "" , meaning we can always have a new beginning ...#SlateSpeak ... I love that idea , and love the idea of being able to hit reset . However , as  notes , "" the past is incarnated in the present "" . Q3 : What things from the past are incarnated in the present and must be addressed if we are to have a new beginning ?#SlateSpeak ...  continues with her quote , "" The present gives birth to the future "" ( from the novel The Bastard of Istanbul [ CN for rape and genocide ] ) ...#SlateSpeak ... Q4 : As we discuss new beginnings and start a new decade , which steps ( small things included ) can we take to give birth to a good future , such that 2030 is better than 2020 ?", Feed his lambs Take care of his sheep Feed his sheep Follow Him #SlateSpeak #Jesus,1

"Life has many difficulties and many needs that one wants to fulfill . Some regrets and sorrows too from the past that one gets used to walking with , keeping company . But for someone who has lacked love and acceptance on so many levels all throughout life ,My life is complete with two things . First and foremost , someone that loves me as I am , unconditionally . Someone in whom I find a home in . My one true love . And second , my health so I can enjoy this life in love . Everything else is just background noise . If I have these twothings , I do not mourn the things lost , I do not fear whats to come , not even death . And I definitely do not fear failure , failure in anything . Because my every step leads to him . In my intoxication of my beloved , I don't even see myself falling and getting up repeatedly , I justproceed toward him in my drunken state . And I strongly believe that when you let this kind of love enter your life fully and unabashedly , you evolve as a human being , as a spiritual being , and when you've got a direct line to the divine , everything around you flourishes , blooms ,the good multiplies , abundance knocks at your door . This is one of the ways , for me personally being the superior way , to realize your full potential . When the masculine and the feminine come together in perfect harmony , without any hesitation or resistance , everything else fallsin place . But you must not resist this love for it requires you to disrobe the defense systems you've put in place . You must thank your survival instincts and put them aside . It is time to ascend . It requires you to let go of many things that hold you back but you are attachedto them nonetheless . They may have served you well in the past , but there is no need for them now . You must submit fully to this kind of love . Your whole life , as tragic as it may be , has lead you to this point . Be grateful for your tragedies especially .This type of love may overwhelm you and scare you at first . you may fear losing control . You may be miserable in your pangs of separation ( hijr ) . You may cry the sorrows of a lifetime . Did you think it was going to be easy , this all-encompassing love ? You do realize you had tobe cleansed of your patterns , of your set in stone thought systems , of your ego . You will definitely be miserable for a while . Like a seed , you must break down from the core to bring out the sacred Life in you . But there is a landfall at the other end of this deep turbulent oceanYou will reach a calm if you allow yourself to stop struggling & just let go . You will come to a point where you are fully present , fully aware of yourself . you'll see your beloved everywhere . How many times have you read , exploring different spiritual thoughts , how important itis to become a witness to self ? And you will , finally . You'll see yourself through your beloved's eyes . There is nothing you'll do , that will not be witnessed . you'll have fallen in love with yourself in exchange . They say , you must learn to love yourself in order to love anotherBut what if it can also be the other way around ? what if you learn t love and care fr yourself through your love for another . Is it so wrong ? It doesn't feel that way . I think this is one way to find God because true unadulterated love is just that , across the board . There are nolabels once it surpasses a certain depth . Ibaadat mein bhi nikhaar aayega . Your spiritual practice will come into clarity . For many of us , we must have some sort of spiritual practice / discipline / ritual ( whatever you want to call it ) in order to journey through this love , in orderto ascend and not fall . How is it that you can witness God through something sacred such as true love ? I think you can . It is possible that the deeper you go in love , the higher you rise to meet Eternity . But yes , I can see that some sort of ritual or practice is necessary tonot veer off or get distracted from the path of love . You may argue that such lovers only meet a tragic end . #sufilovers Yes , they do in stories that you hear . Would you read a story about a couple that lives together in love for the rest of their lives ? It would become justanother children's fairy tale . for a love story to shake you spiritually , it has to have a tragic end , namely death , to realize that it goes beyond this lifetime , death being just a stage . But there are lovers that live happily ever after . That old couple walking slowly beforeyou , supporting each other , the one sipping tea / coffee at the same cafe every day , the one that you read about that died within moments of each other , holding hands , or the young couple that finds solace and peace in each other's arms after a hard day's work . Any one of themcould be a divine / sacred couple . What did you think they walk around with halos above them ? or some spotlight shining on them ? not all enlightened souls become gurus and start giving discourses . many if not most , just live small , peaceful ( mostly ) , lives of domestic bliss as theygrow together through their conflicts and spiritually , live the mysteries of Life / Existence together hand in hand . having said all this , its sad that not everyone finds that one true love . It can't be just anyone . It can't be produced out of nothing . Somehow the whole universemust work together to bring two people together that belong together in such a way . It is by the grace of God that these two find each other journeying through lifetimes . And once they're brought together by some divine intervention , they must recognize the signs , accept , work on","their conditioning , and most of all , nurture this love and not let it go . They must recognize the blessing , the miracle that it is to have found their other spiritual half . #life #spirituallove #sufilove",1

"Interesting question . It takes 3-5 days to become addicted to heroin , so I guess the law of averages means they would be unlucky to feed from addicts that many days in a row . Or maybe the undead are just immune to addiction . 🤔  I think it depends on the lore you are following but I think blood in itself is supposed to be both like a drug and their sustinence . In some lore they can't eat or drink anything but blood , in others they can but no effect , in some they can get drunk ... If they can get drunk ... ... then I'd infer they can get addicted to alcohol too .. so I'd suggest they could get addicted to a drug that was in the blood .. perhaps ... Although how much would need to be in the bloodstream to affect them ? This has opened up a whole Pandora ’ s box ! 😂 opiates are extremely addictive , so wouldn ’ t require large amounts to become addicted . I didn ’ t think we ’ d end up discussing vampire drug addiction today ! 😂 this is why I love Twitter ! ! 😁 👍 🏼 Better hope they don't eat a stoner .. A vampire with the munchies would not be a good thing .","  Haha . Stoners are habitual but not addicts in the same way as a chemically dependant addict like an opiate user or freebaser would be ... still the image of a vampire with the munchies , getting fat on stoner blood is amazing .

So in the past two days I have finished Mindhunter and The Witcher . Big up yourselves    I lost my way in Witchhunter mate . Couldn ’ t tell you who was who or what was happening . Had you played the game / known it before ?  Nah hadn't played the game but figured it out after a while ! There was a lot of time jumping which they didnt make clear but I managed to get it in the end !  I finished it ... but out of stubbornness ! Hahah I love a good fantasy fight scene so kept me for that . Thought your man was pretty beige too ! ?  Yeah I did at first too but realised that was part of his character . I was a bit gutted we didnt see the Bard again ! I have never been in to fantasy so I was popping my cherry but I liked it !  Yeah never watched either ! When GOT came out it was the choice of that or The Walking Dead to commit too and I sadly chose the later,   Giri / Haji is now available on . Or you can watch it on .,1

I won a junior goat milking championship  Didn't know you smoked ! And I now have to hear the clown story ! Aye , terrible habit I'm planning to kick once I'm doing better mentally ! So basically my friend and I got tickets for a local circus . After the show was over we hung around and chatted a bit , and after some time the artists came out to have a beer together . They spotted us and asked if we'd like to share a beer with them , how we liked the show etc etc and as she was vibing with one of the acrobats I was hanging out with this other guy who turned out to be the clown . Anyway at some point we were heading home and the clown walked me to my bike and then asked if he could steal a kiss .

I don't think very many people on the left are taking that argument seriously , but if people are yikes . Heartening to see a different dialogue around this Middle East situation than in the past . Right , but you didn't talk about the left . You said on here . Stay focused , brother .

"“ When you take into account the forests and other ecosystems that would otherwise grow on land used by livestock , scientists estimate the carbon cost of just 4 kg of beef is equivalent to taking a flight from London to New York and back again . ”  1/2Searchinger et al estimate the global av carbon opportunity cost of beef is 1250kg per kg of protein . The protein content of beef ~ 25 % . Figures from Atmosfair suggest a return flight from London to New York generates about 986kg of CO2 per passenger .  2/2“ Government figures show that livestock farms in the UK receive on average £ 26,000 a year in subsidies . ” “ Remember those 23m sheep that occupy so much of the UK ? Well , they provide just over 1 % of our food , in terms of calories . ” Total av consumption of lamb + mutton in UK is 5.0 kg per person per year :  1/2100g of lamb contains approximately 294kcal .  So annual av calorie intake from lamb is ~ 14,700 kcal . Annual av total calorie intake per person in the UK is ~ 1,250 , 000 kcal :  . Therefore lamb provides roughly 1.18 % of our calories . 2/2“ But , the surprising truth is that it [ free range meat ] causes more damage to the living world than indoor livestock farming , because it uses much more land , mostly for pasture :  “ One third of the world ’ s crops are being grown to feed to livestock . ” “ ninety percent of all the soya humans consume is embedded in fish , eggs , meat and dairy . ” “ you look at the net carbon impacts of livestock , they ’ re horrendous . ” “ Rivers which are now polluted more by farming than by any other industry . ” “ only fourteen percent of rivers in England and Wales are in good ecological health – an even worse figure than a few years ago . “  “ In America , factory farms are producing thirteen times more sewage than all the humans put together . ” “ It is being damaged so quickly that , according to the UN , we have just sixty years of harvests left . ” “ At this rate , farming won ’ t be able to feed the growing human population . ” “ The number of farm animals is increasing twice as fast as the number of humans . ” “ In Britain alone , we eat so much meat that we use twice as much farmland as the country possesses . ” The UK ’ s agricultural land footprint is 408,090 km2 . The area of land in the UK used for agriculture is 171,900 km2 .  “ Food ’ s global footprint would be miniaturised . ” Currently the most land-efficient means of growing protein is South American soya , which produces 2.5 tonnes per hectare per year . Solar Foods ’ manufacturing projection is 50,000 tonnes per hectare per year .“ the team claims they could supply enough protein to feed all the world ’ s people in an area the size of Ohio . ” Daily protein requirement : 50g . x 7.5 billion = 140mt pa . 50,000 t per ha pa means 2800 hectares .

"The job action will be the fourth held by the Ontario Secondary School Teachers ' Federation in an attempt to ramp pressure on the provincial government during contract talks .  Weird when they had two weeks to protest while students wouldn't be hurt they chose to spend it on vacation . But now the students are back , it's a good time to strike . You know , for the kids .  Weird that the government had all summer to show up at the bargaining table but they were on shut down . The cuts they are making hurt kids far more than one day rotating strikes !",  So its vendictiveness why teachers sat out the last 2 weeks rather than fighting . They figure that the government didn't put in an effort why should they . Interesting . And your response is since the government wants to hurt students that you will also hurt students .,1

I didn ’ t see any top end athleticism talk for him and people labeling him with that isn ’ t his fault and doesn ’ t change what he ’ s done  Takes great angles , and has awesome instincts , especially for a rookie .

Dallas total offense ranked in top 10 and all statistical categories better individual and team than Min . #Grind   Facts ... depending on how you sort them . Yardage stats . Heck you ’ re so smart I ’ m surprised you ’ re not a gm . It seems so simple . Too bad it ’ s not that simple . Prob won your fantasy league with this kind of factual knowledge . Did you ?   Sort them every way you want and it still comes out with the Cowboys being statistically better than the Vikes . Too much work for you ? Use something other than Fantasy pokes as your basis .

"I think this is an interesting column .

"Not when incivility , terrorism and outright madness are prevailing in #Iran  Everything was under control until Orange Mayhem stepped up to the mic . Postponing the #evil day was the game . #Trump put an end to the evil day . The other night was only the opening act of the revenge , according to the new top General of Iran . You probably don't think they will attack again . Non-thinkers talk as if each shoe was the last to drop . Trump is facing all kinds of hurdles , including potential felony charges . You got it all wrong . In any case , we'll see about that when we get there . #Trump is invincible ! Mostly , I'm trolling you idiots for fun and don't always say what I really mean . I'm actually right-leaning and always voted for Republican presidential candidates ( since 1984 ) but reject #Trump on many levels , plus I haven't lost my mind like so many of you . I don't live for the #GOP anymore , they don't do that much for me , I guess , plus corruption and lies .", Republican under #Trump is different and Trump is doing it differently with the dexterity of a .,1
"I just did a really good job at a reflection meeting with my new carer . I reviewed our work over the past months , explained what went well and what didn ‘ t , educated about my #autism , my needs , and gave some ideas on what to do instead to support me better . #SelfAdvocateMy carer did a great job being surprised at all the invisible challenges I went through with him right there without having a clue 🤣 He also did a great job listening , asking detailed questions , taking me seriously , and treating me like the expert on my own brain that I am . 👍 🏻I am so glad I found a carer who I feel safe enough with to actually freely discuss these things with . Because if I can ‘ t tell my carer what they did wrong , and how to do better ... I ‘ m not getting the support I need that they ‘ re supposed to provide me ! Trust is SO important .This meeting also illustrated one thing very well to me : My autistic traits are visible . But all the challenges of life happen inside of my bain and are invisible to observers . Others often can ‘ t see what causes me problems . Which is why good communication is SO important !It ‘ s also quite fascinating to see my non-autistic carer understand that something he didn ‘ t even think about is a serious problem for me . I really struggle with facial expression , but his surprised face was SO obvious , even I could read it . Not 😯 Not even 😮 More like 😲This is after having had a carer I couldn ‘ t trust , and didn ‘ t feel safe and comfortable discussing my problems and needs with . This is a very private , and intimate process ... it requires trust . No trust for me = inadequate support because I can ‘ t advocate for myself properly .", Thank you for sharing your story . I love happy stories . Trust and Truth are extremely valuable . Glad you have them . May others learn and grow from this example !,1
"Dear Iran , Here ’ s the map incase your confused as to where to attack  Fixed ur map . Dear Iran , The places in blue are just innocent bystanders ... we just happen to live here .

"Honorary Doctor of Science . Biology shows explicitly that human life begins at conception . Academia is celebrating someone who , despite this , promotes the deliberate taking of life . This was not an academic honour . It was political applause .  The altar stripped , the tabernacle empty ; Ichabod ; the glory has departed . From your mouth to God's ear . It feels to me that the Christian Church in general is being marginalised so badly . From within too . As events like this indicate .", Of course it is . Don't be surprised . Or disappointed .

"So ... this week a group of cherished friends and I were subjected to the worst  experience of all time . Before the shade commences , I would like to say that as a company , Airbnb EVENTUALLY stepped up and took care of some of our concerns .  This "" eventually "" concept of wearing customers down through indifference and hoping they just give up and take poor treatment is why the gig / sharing economy is fundamentally flawed . I know it's just your shitty house or car , but I'm still giving you $ $ $ .  We booked it because we had a unique group of people ( couples , singles , and a teenager ) so the layout seemed perfect . It was expensive , but we needed the space . It seemed very Florida ... but we were about to find out just how Florida it was ...  The property we were greeted by was a dilapidated shack , each floor more dangerous and disgusting than the next . We never felt safe , we barely slept , and for our troubles we were harassed with threats from the hosts and evicted on New Year ’ s Eve .  First impression : a large and garish “ WE BUY HOUSES FOR CASH ” sign on a trailer was parked in our driveway when we arrived . Uh-oh . ","  Technically , in the grass next to the drive way :-)",1

My anger is real and not dissapating .   deserves to be #Impeached . He might not deserve to be removed but that's what the Senate is for . My question remains , what substantive policy changes had Amash made that should change your vote . This is politics , not #schoolyard #politics .

Thx Joanne Another of my fav books is CIEN AÑOS DE S O L E D A D    I tried reading that book in Spanish and it got the best of me !

You reminded me when I didn't understand a word of English . When I came to this country , I got in school 2 months after the year had started , so I was behind and frustrated , and I swore to myself I'll learn quickly in my ESL class , I ended up being the teacher's aide .

"1 . I ’ ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I ’ ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is “ razor thin ” .2 . In fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts : a ) A pattern of travel showing Suleimani was in Syria , Lebanon & Iraq to meet with Shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the US . ( As one source said that ’ s just “ business as usual ” for Suleimani )3 . More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader ’ s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything .4 . And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran ’ s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy .5 . But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap .6 . One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . 27 , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the “ far out option ”7 . Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : 8 . It was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one US official , chose the Suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that American intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . They scrambled to locate him , says the official .9 . According to the official , the strike on Suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the US was not sure PMF leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was in the convoy . He was also killed and is also viewed as an Iranian proxy : 10 . Since the strike , Iran has convened its national security chiefs . Chatter intercepted by American intelligence indicates they ’ re considering a range of options . Cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and American personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far .11 . But among the “ menu options ” that I had not heard before were : ( 1 ) kidnapping and execution of American citizens . ( This might explain why the State Department has ordered the evacuation of all US citizens in Iraq , not just government and embassy employees ) . 12 . Another is attacks on American diplomatic and military outposts not just in Iraq , Lebanon and Syria , but as far afield as UAE and Bahrain . The official I spoke to was particularly concerned for American troops stationed in Iraq , some of whom are co-located with Shia militias13 . How does this impact the war against ISIS ? I turned to  for insight . He ’ s studied Iraq since the 1990s . What he told me is that months before the strike that killed Suleimani , the tensions with Iran had already degraded America ’ s ability to fight ISIS in Iraq :14 . In 2019 , America has been denied airspace and access to operations in Iraq to go after ISIS at the behest of Iran-backed groups . The US has also been told to stop communicating with Sunni tribes . These are important setbacks that have already weakened the US ’ posture in Iraq15 . “ It ’ s all been downhill , ”  told me , in terms of America ’ s access to the ISIS battlespace in recent months due to Iranian pressure on Iraqi officials . One upshot ? US special operations forces have been on the offensive in Diyala , Nineveh and Kirkuk provinces16 . A likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out-of-the-way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . Fighting ISIS is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the US embassy is being attacked .17 . Before I go back to the pool let me just say the obvious : No one ’ s trying to downplay Suleimani ’ s crimes . The question is why now ? His whereabouts have been known before . His resume of killing-by-proxy is not a secret . Hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga .", Ahhh ! So Trump planned the mournful protesters at the US Embassy on New Year ’ s Eve !,1

"I'm not pro-Iran , I'm pro-Iranian sovereignty . As someone that has argued pro-British sovereignty for the last few years , it would be hypocritical of me to do anything else . Any UK position that undermines Iranian sovereignty , is counter-productive to our own sovereignty . It's a shame Iran doesn't recognise the sovereignty of others in the region , instead it uses them for proxy wars How many more need to starve in Yemen before something is done The Iranians would be obliterated by a war with the US , they know it . But they also need to save face Proxy wars , against whom ? Iran isn't at war with Yemen . Saudi Arabia ( with US backing ) is . Talk about a proxy war ! The notion Iran would be obliterated by an ineffective force like the US , against Iran's geography and regional guerrilla experience is laughable . Ok let's start with your first point , yes Saudi is fighting a proxy war in Yemen ... but weird thing about wars , there is usually more than one side 🙄 The other side is Iran  Second point Iran has no airforce and no tanks ... so yes obliterated "," If Saudi was fighting with Yemen , as you suggest , it wouldn't be a proxy war , it would just be a war",1

Unfortunately our economists & politicians are far too consumed by their lust for "" growth "" to consider any more meaningful thoughts .",  And driven by #closed #mindsets no #heart or & & I acknowledge and pay my respect to the original owners of these sacred lands and waterways,1

Idk if it ’ s just due to me following almost 100 % lgbt + supporters / people but all this love for  that I ’ ve seen is truly astounding and makes me feel sooo happy is the perfect example of trans people being people and that we shouldn ’ t have to be defined by the label . Don ’ t get me wrong I take pride in my trans label but it is not everything to me .Nikkie showed us that trans people can go out and be happy and successful people just like any other person we trans people are no different and had she not been forced people would never have known which is more often then not the caseTrans people are all around you we always have been and always will be . We are normal people who have multiple layers . We are not pedophiles sneaking into bathrooms . We did not make this choice .This is who we are . We didn ’ t ask to make life so much harder . Trans women of color are the most targeted group . There are so many trans deaths that are overlooked and my hope is that thanks to Nikkies courage people might look at trans people differently and more openly,All my love and support to this wonderful woman  people took away your choice to come out but you have dealt with this so beautifully and so strong ! You are a great inspiration for so many ! #nikkitutorials #translivesmatter #inspiration,1

"1 / I remember this #story about a #nightingale who was the most beautiful and sought-after bird in the whole kingdom . Its voice was so #melodious that fishermen and maids stopped whatever they were doing and listened intently to the nightingale ’ s song .2 / One day , the kingdom ’ s emperor hears about the #nightingale , and he becomes incensed at knowing that a simple bird can usurp him with its voice .3 / Stung in his #pride , he asks his first lord to go and fetch the bird so he can see for #himself what is it about its #voice that is so special .4 / The first lord #fearfully scourges the land wide to find the #nightingale himself , for the Emperor threatens to have him trampled to death if he fails . At last , he finds the bird deep in the forest ,5 / The nightingale #agrees , and shows up at court . The emperor sheds moving tears upon hearing the bird ’ s singing #voice ; this gesture greatly #touches the nightingale ’ s heart .6 / Wanting to hear the bird #sing some more for himself , the emperor #builds him a golden cage and gives him servants . Servants attach the bird ’ s left leg to them as they care for him .7 / One day , the #emperor receives a #present . It is a mechanical nightingale adorned with diamonds and sparkling jewels . The #mechanical bird pleases him greatly , for it seems to sing perfectly every note at the ’ s wimp .8/ Feeling the emperor ’ s #attention drawn #elsewhere , the nightingale sees his chance to be free once again and he #returns to live in the forest .9 / Some time later , the #mechanical nightingale breaks down . Sad and depressed , the emperor becomes greatly #ill .10 / On his death bed , he #remembers the nightingale who once #soothed his aching heart . Crying , he prays for its return with all his heart . The #nightingale hears his plea and comes in the middle of the night , sitting on a branch outside his bedroom .11 / The emperor is so grateful to hear the bird ’ s voice again that he asks the nightingale to never leave his side again .12 / The nightingale agrees on one condition : being free . In return , it will visit with the emperor and sing its love song .13 / Let me #ask you , What do you #believe is the nightingale ’ s #story about ? I ’ d like to offer you the following suggestion : What if the nightingale represents our inner ? If that ’ s the case , Who or what does the emperor represent ?","14 / I believe the emperor #represents our #ego , that thing that tries to cage everything in and around #us .",1

"The young woman was speaking thru a Mandarin interpreter . She started walking back toward the jail cells . Officers turned her around & pointed to freedom . Head down she walked out of court . Turned around to students . Riveted . I pointed out a couple of things from those 2 minutes :1 . Notice how she had her retinas scanned before she was brought up ? State surveillance . 2 . Most charged w / prostitution are sex workers who want agency or human trafficking victims . Why arrest / prosecute at all ? 3 . 9/10 judges would have granted dismissal . Justice is arbitrary .I know theyre 5th graders . But responses & thoughtfulness earlier earned real talk on difficult subjects . They got it . "" Jail doesn't help people that are already victims . "" "" But she [ the judge ] seemed so nice earlier . "" "" What happens now ? "" Hands raising right & left . But next case :Man charged w / assault in second degree . Prosecution consented to his release . Lessons : * Prosecutors have a lot of power . * When they decide to let someone to go home , judge will release them . Doesn't matter the charges . They could stop pretrial detention today if they wanted to .Hand raised . Girl who hadnt spoken . "" The ppl really seem to like their public defenders . "" Told them how impt it is to build trust w / ppl you represent & vice-versa . How everyone has so much in common w / each other even if we couldnt seem more different . How difficult it often is .Young girl lead out next . Robbery charge for stealing jewelry from cousin during fight . Prosecution again consents to release ( good on them ) . But requests , as always , a stay away order . Colleague raises issues that may arise at family functions . Judge allows incidental contact .Lessons : ( 1 ) Again , power of prosecutors to limit jail ( good ) . ( 2 ) Prosecutors power to not charge the highest possible charge as they did here knowing that it really is no more than a family fight ( bad ) . ( 3 ) The impact that orders of protection can have , esp on family members .Last case students saw : Charge of 1st degree robbery . Claim : Client pretended to have firearm in pocket . Stole chain & money from someone in store . Prosecution requested $ 25k bail . A woman in the audience cried out at the amount . The students all looked . Whispers : "" It's his mom . ""Colleague first castigated prosecution for bringing up prior cases he brought up should have been sealed bc of his age at the time . Note : Youthful & juvenile offender records supposed to be sealed , but still show up on RAP sheets . Then turned to facts :He was just outside & not involved in anything . Thats what put him in police radar for arrest & later lineup . Our office went down to precinct w / him ( already rep him on open lowlevel case thatll be dismissed ) . Requested fair lineup . Colleague had photo of it . It . Was . Not . Fair .Colleague showed photo to judge . Started to describe : "" He was only skinny , light-skinned black man . To his right is a hefty white man . "" Judge cut her off . "" This isn't a trial or suppression hearing . "" "" True , but strength of case is relevant to your bail decision . "" ( Shes right ) .Colleague proceeded : In close touch with our office . Mother in audience . Can't possibly afford anything close to $ 50k ( note : Mistake above in thread . Prosecution asked for $ 50k ) . Making all current court appearances . Case will go nowhere . "" Please release him . "" Bail set : $ 25k .Mom started crying . Walked out . Young man guided back toward the cells behind courtroom . Heard whispers : "" He's going to jail . "" "" Rikers Island . "" Looked & the students were bothered . One girl whispered a question : "" If he needed a public defender , how could he afford $ 25k ? "" Bingo .Walked out of court , past mom crying w / his attorney , & sat down on benches . Answered the girl : "" He can't afford $ 25k . Most of my clients can't afford $ 100 . "" Explained bail was supposed to be incentive . Law only allows bail enough to ensure return to court . They were thinking ."" Then why did she set bail higher than he could pay if she knew he couldn't afford it ? "" Explained judges are human . Humans driven by fear . Nothing bad could happen to her if he goes to jail . But if she did right , legal thing , she could lose her job if anything bad happened .Another girl : "" But if law says you cant do bail higher than they can afford , didn't she just commit a crime ? "" "" No , but she violated state law & Constitution . "" A boy : "" What happens to her then ? "" Me : "" We appeal arguing she ' abused her discretion . ' They usually get denied . "" "" Why ? """" Because the judges reviewing bail decisions work in the same courts & know her . They work together . How do you think she'd feel if one of our colleagues said she "" abused her discretion . "" "" Really bad . "" "" Remember : Again , all judges are human . All too often , feelings trump law . ""Students had hard time wrapping their heads around how judge could just do that & get away w / it . It's hard , frankly , for me to wrap my head around . Explained it's also about incentives . If we celebrate mercy , leniency , rationality more across system , we'd all be better off .I mentioned how I never could be a criminal court judge . How I'd never want to be empowered to jail someone . One of the smallest of the kids said : "" Seeing all that * made me want to be a criminal court judge . So that I could have the power to do the right thing . "" Praised him .There were a number of other questions . Then time was up . Walked outside . Took a photo in front of the courthouse . And mutual thank yous . I told them how incredibly impressed I was with them , & told them they all give me hope for the future of criminal "" justice . "" They really do .", You are an awesome human being . This will stay with them as will you . #faith #DoingTheRightThing,1

"Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American , & badly wounded many others , not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime , including recently ...... hundreds of Iranian protesters . He was already attacking our Embassy , and preparing for additional hits in other locations . Iran has been nothing but problems for many years . Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans , or American assets , we have ...... targeted 52 Iranian sites ( representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago ) , some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture , and those targets , and Iran itself , WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD .

"This is how children are protected ... good strong men w / moral fortitude , who are willing to do the right thing , and stand against Predatory practices !  Do you have an opinion about male circumcision in the USA ? I take a historical Judeo-Christian perspective on male circumcision . It seems to be frowned upon in modern Men's Rights circles . The Bible speaks highly & preferentially of a "" Circumcision of the Heart "" . Is there a medical case still supporting a public health narrative ?  Speaking specifically to the verse you referenced , from a Christian perspective , it doesn't carry the same requirements / connotation as it did for the Jews . However , I am persuaded that the Lord had a lot in mind when he instituted male circumcision . So , I do believe in it . Paul , who was himself a Jewish pharisee at one point , addressed the practice at length ( no pun intended ) in some of his writings .  Likely , the closest thing we as Christians grapple w / , that might raise similar internal struggles , is w / giving , communion , the amt . of church attendance , & baptism . Though we're not under law , it's still important to discern the principles involved so we can be led by the Lord . The apostles fought about the subject at times ( Galatians 2 ) . I believe that some people even consider it as type of mark Jews use to signify gentile fealty . There is even debate within psychology as to the merits of male circumcision .  I am aware that there is a movement to ban the practice . As a dad , it was emotionally painful to have my infant boys go through the procedure . But , that is a belief I hold ... that the Lord initiated a practice that held true for 6000 yrs , so it likely is important to practice . Just being aware of little conflicts of conscience , empathy with other males , & ideas that the practice is culturally & spiritually significant is valuable . I had an enlightening experience investigating relationships between #circumcision & #baptism .  I think that is vital , if we are to mature . Grace gives us freedom to follow an informed conscience . Hence , as Peter said in 2 Pet 3:18 , we need to grow in both grace and knowledge , which is accomplished by maturity & growth ( 2 Pet 1:3- 8) . We can trust the Lord can mature others . It's just that easy to find intersectionality in psychology & religon . 😁 Self actualization is built into many theological frameworks ! Free will , both produces & removes anxiety ! How often is trust central to trauma-work ? All the time . Trust in God can be a hurdle for survivors . "" Self-actualization "" is different for Christians vs . non . For Christians , it is Christ-likeness , leading to holiness . For others , it is self-fulfillment & happiness . Grieving is central to the healing process , which requires one to wrestle w / the big issues , as in the bk of Job .", Consider how powerless Job ended up before #God . That passage is for a strong person like Job to #endure . I have found that #Christ has an ability to turn to . This can be very empowering to survivors in emotional wildernesses . ,1

"Is it wrong I'm from the South and just not into Popeyes yard bird ? They do have some good dirty rice . Barry should stop eating there & try Churches . Much better fried chicken INMHO . Excellent . I take my fried chicken seriously & hate it when people try to force me to eat the chicken they think I should eat . That will start a war in my house . LOL . Just like the man a woman chooses to date / marry - - chicken choices shouldn't be forced - - that's why I got away from the wise family members with control issues in those departments . Life is so much more peaceful with out those babies . 😉 😉 😉 I know how that works Yup Live a long distance from the family Yup . Mine was my deceased husbands family and a stray biological great uncle in biz with my late hubs , not my true fam that lives near me as they would never force anything on anyone .

"Worth repeating . The testimony & evidence considered in a Senate impeachment trial should be the same testimony & evidence the House relied upon when they passed the Articles of Impeachment . Our job is to vote on what the House passed , not to conduct an open ended inquiry . No . You're 100 % wrong . A Trial requires : • Evidence • Witnesses Your job , Senator Rubio , is to be an * impartial * juror .  So does an indictment , and yet the House chose to pass the Articles anyway . Both things also require a crime , which was also lacking in the whole thing . They alleged a crime in the beginning , but then never included that crime in the Articles .   Which came first : the Constitution , or the USC ?   Does it matter if neither Abuse of Power nor Obstruction of Congress are codified as criminal acts ?   Yes it does matter that they are not crimes . Obstruction of congress is part of the duties of the executive branch . And abuse of power is so common , as well as a matter of opinion ( in most cases )","   Inditeable crimes are not required . Obstruction of other branches is not legal behavior , but it figures the would see it that way .",1
"I need people who can tag my tweets to Media .. Local newspapers and TV channels ... Just 1 tweet every 2 or 3 days ... Can you do that ? ... dont respond to this tweet by saying YES ... start tagging   Don't preach non sense here . Stop deceiving people and selling false miracle to get poor converted to Christianity . That is what this channel is trying to achieve . We are not killing anyone . Religion is personal and best kept privte . You with your convrson are wiping out cultures   So you are saying you will bring violence to anyone that says something that you do not agree with ? An eye for an eye and the whole world is blind Even Gandhi from India preached non violence We repeat the same mistakes and wonder why se dont make progress Open your mind bud .   Stop preaching nonsense and come to the point . Shove Gandhi in your a $ $ . You have no right to defame Hindu Gods and start praising yours to gain followers by deceiving people . Don't expect us to keep looking when you don't understand the mistake your are doing .   This time it is no more eye for an eye .. you defame us we will come back with 10x more violence . Don't play your victim card here . Grow up ignorant idiot   Please note , here is a mentally deranged individual that needs to curtail his violence . She is out to do no good . Reporting this tweet for action   Oh Twitter .. please on the name of Jesus .. I request you to suspend my account . 😂 😂 😂 😀 😀 . Enough amusement . get out of this discussions now   Add 1 acre land and 2 tolas gold . You forgot ? Watch what happens when you accuse leftists of the same crime ... Mythology is just that . Countless fairy tales repeated over and over by dongi baba's and botched rewrites and violence through religion Let the drum roll begin ...   1 acre land and 2 tolas gold ? Did they give your ancestors that as well to abandon their actual religion and embrace Christianity ? What mythology are you taking about ? Remember we are not blaming you but peple who deceive poor and convert . Don't discuss dhongi babas to defend them   Everyone who converts gets 50 tolas gold . You don't know ? That's why #Christians are most persecuted in the world esp by #RadicalIslam but soon #radicals in will start too Why Mythology never taught in schools ? Because syllabus only has History ! Real events   Not intersted to know how much givn to traitors to get converted . Well if Christians are most persecuted ... the reason must be because you fools are trying to conquer the world with your religion and wiping out cultures . Hindu mythology never taught because that was is wrong hands   In that case you are FAR FAR departed from your Santana Dharm because nowhere does Hindu mythology maintain violence , like you do !   Don't teach me Sanatan Dharma . My dhrama also says if anyone is doing wrong , I have all right to stop that that from happening , let that be done with violence . Religion is persnal and best kept privte . You are not here to conquer the world with your religion . Don't deceive people   This is why #Missionary is winning ... They teach #violent people like you more #peace about your own that even tou know about Had you cared to spread the , you would have put out of   You see the stupid totka with name of Jesus doesn't work . You still back with your stupidity and trying to defend your actions . Truth is ur God is a insecure dumb who had ordered u people to go and convert , so that u can conquer the world with ur religion .   See your own logic : Call me stup 1d , Call others stup 1d , Label the whole religion stup 1d , smear all of society . Will never work If your Truth is my God is a insecure dumb who had ordered people to go and convert , Why is your God and Santana dharma separating people with caste ?   Go learn why this system was bought and how it took a bad turn . This was bought to differentiate the work people do and later took an ugly turn . No one supports caste system anymore . That's a very old believe now . We all Hindus leave in harmony .. some peple in villags still follow",   I understand . So if no one follows caste system anymore why are there so many conversions ? There maybe dongi pastors But None are violent unlike #jihad How can you convince people who still feel enslaved in villages that they are all equal ? That's #Jesus message,1

"Okay , everybody , stand down . If meeting with Trudeau helped this poor guy with his unimaginable grief , that's a good thing : ‘ He cried with me ’ : Ontario man who lost son , wife in Iran plane crash meets with Justin Trudeau  Stand down from what , Lorrie ? I have nothing but admiration for the Prime Minister and the way he's conducted himself during a very difficult week .  You ’ re a fool if you admire that clown and your type are the reason we are in this mess . The man is an empty suit , void of any intelligence and experience . He is ... a drama teacher ...  He is the most admired leader in the western world , he has led our country out of the Stephen Harper recession , growth is going gangbusters and you think he's an empty suit ? What does that make you ? And what mess , by the way ? Best growth in the G7 ?  “ Stephen Harper recession ” was a world recession that he guided us through moron . We have outrageous deficits right now in a time where the economy is doing well despite Trudeau . And he is admired by nobody but mindless liberal shills .  "" The economy is doing well despite Trudeau "" . You DO realize how ridiculous that sounds . Why do you think our economy is the best in the G7 ? We recently vaulted from something like 12th economy in the world to 8th largest . Who do you think is responsible for that ? Why ? Idiot .  Amazing what 80 + billion dollar deficits can buy isn ’ t it ? Stick to your bandwidth pal and leave economics to the adults .  Amazing that the rubes still don't understand managing a national economy is nothing like managing a household budget . Money is so cheap now , it makes no sense to spend your own . Much better traction is obtained by borrowing for growth .  I ’ m just gonna pretend I didn ’ t see this . Sir your stupidly is showing . You may be one of the stupidest people I ’ ve encountered . But hey “ the budget will balance itself ” .  - Best growth in the G7 - Declining debt to GDP ratio - Unprecedented demand for visas - Lowest unemployment in 45 years - 400,000 children rescued from poverty - 300,000 new jobs in 3 years - The country is happy again What is it you people want that he's not delivering ?","   Liberal fake speaking points that are rediculous at best . Printing money to run huge deficits is not an economy & we are paying the price in Ontario for the same ignorance and incompetence .

"I just did a really good job at a reflection meeting with my new carer . I reviewed our work over the past months , explained what went well and what didn ‘ t , educated about my #autism , my needs , and gave some ideas on what to do instead to support me better . #SelfAdvocateMy carer did a great job being surprised at all the invisible challenges I went through with him right there without having a clue 🤣 He also did a great job listening , asking detailed questions , taking me seriously , and treating me like the expert on my own brain that I am . 👍 🏻I am so glad I found a carer who I feel safe enough with to actually freely discuss these things with . Because if I can ‘ t tell my carer what they did wrong , and how to do better ... I ‘ m not getting the support I need that they ‘ re supposed to provide me ! Trust is SO important .This meeting also illustrated one thing very well to me : My autistic traits are visible . But all the challenges of life happen inside of my bain and are invisible to observers . Others often can ‘ t see what causes me problems . Which is why good communication is SO important !It ‘ s also quite fascinating to see my non-autistic carer understand that something he didn ‘ t even think about is a serious problem for me . I really struggle with facial expression , but his surprised face was SO obvious , even I could read it . Not 😯 Not even 😮 More like 😲This is after having had a carer I couldn ‘ t trust , and didn ‘ t feel safe and comfortable discussing my problems and needs with . This is a very private , and intimate process ... it requires trust . No trust for me = inadequate support because I can ‘ t advocate for myself properly .", Thank you for sharing your story . I love happy stories . Trust and Truth are extremely valuable . Glad you have them . May others learn and grow from this example !,1

"Welcome back Hannah . Interesting article worthy of a read by all . I believe in the power of a free press & that mainstream media should be part of the Sussexes comm ’ s strategy . But , the royal rota system is broken & the contract should be renegotiated .   Royal Rota or no Royal Rota , the press will still write stories about the Sussex ’ s . I understand why they say that but I don ’ t think it will really change anything . If the papers want to spin a story they will just take the info off the Instagram page 🤷 ‍ ♀ ️  Yep . I don ’ t think they ’ re worried about finding people to cover them . H & M tried to push for the rota system to be revamped . They were rebuffed . Now they can build a model from the ground up .  I am saying it is not going to stop the current reporters writing about them","   Of course racist rags will continue to write racist garbage , but now a far more diverse group of journalists will cover them directly . That ’ s HUGE and the RRs know it . One of the most popular couples in the world can decide who has first dibs / photos on their stories .",1

"I ’ m massively optimistic because Lampard has shown he ’ s a top market operator . Doesn ’ t settle for dross / short term solutions . Identifies targets and has insane pull power to actually land them . How can you say he has insane pull power when we haven't signed anyone yet lmao . Because he ’ s Frank James Lampard . He ’ s not some banker from Italy , nor is he a catenaccio bloke . He ’ s flexible , works for a top club , and is a footballing legend . Look at the links chap . Devils in the details . So being linked with a player means he has pull power ? Give journalists and the scouts a raise then . We've made it because we are being linked with Sancho and Werner 👍 Aren ’ t you just the most simple minded chap . Who were Conte ’ s targets ? Sarri ’ s ? They ’ re entirely different to Lampard ’ s who ’ s targets are elite prospects , not Serie A bum boys .  Sarri had us getting linked to some top top prospects pal  Hysaj ? Higuain ? Rugani ? Top top top prospects those are .  Was thinking more Aouar / Guimaraes / Ndombele / Barella but sure  Barella stinks , Guimarães was a club target and we were NEVER in for Ndombélé mate . Club chose Kovacic over him , lowkey a dub because this brother is moving like Abou Diaby .",  All of these players were linked to us under Sarri and Barella is at football,1
"New to #QAnon #GreatAwakening #WWG1WGA ? It is an overwhelming eye opener to the EVIL in our World.Say the name of Jesus he will comfort you during this process of exposure . God is carefully planning-What part do you Play ? Could the Dig.Soldiers be the Army in Joel ? Do not look to Q for salvation , or for heaven on earth . "" And it shall come to pass , that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered : for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance , as the Lord hath said , and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call . "" Q is not salvation ... Q is exposing , after Exposure we need Jesus if we don't have him yet . Jesus saves : "" Put not your trust in princes , nor in the son of man , in whom there is no help . His breath goeth forth , he returneth to his earth ; in that very day his thoughts perish . Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help , whose hope is in the Lord his God ...

"   The official Monet Unit or standard adopted by England in 1903 , then the American Colonies , then Constitution was the Spanish Milled Dollar — or "" Pieces of Eight "" , a fixed weight of silver .   • The only "" Money "" Congress can bring into existence is silver & gold in the form of "" Coin "" . ART I , SEC 8 CL 5 . • States must use silver & gold only in all State governmental fiscal transactions . ART I , SEC 10 , CL1 .   The government also defined the dollar as 1/20 th of an oz of gold . But none of that matters . You're claim is that banks didn't use gold as specie to issue fiduciary media and that's batshit insane   Wrong . The companion coinage first minted in the U . S . in gold were designated as "" eagles "" not "" dollars "" , because a "" dollar "" is a fixed weight of silver . This is elementary .   No one is disputing that . Why you think that means there wasn't a gold standard is beyond me . You clearly have no idea how the banking system worked in the 29th century   Because the Money Unit or standard by in fact & law is silver .   You obviously don't know what the term gold standard means   Do you have a link to your money bill based on your "" gold standard "" ?   Can you for the record just explicitly state that banks didn't use gold specie just so everyone knows you're a crazy person ?   Let's see your money bill . Let's see your "" sanity "" . Surely you can't just be a Twitter scholar with nothing to back up your "" expertise "" .   I already linked you to two books on monetary history   Other people's books are not a bill . Talk is cheap . Let's see how your system is implemented . Do you have a link to your money bill based on your "" gold standard "" ?   I honestly can ’ t follow what you ’ re trying to do here , but is this what you ’ re looking for , the act where gold is made the only standard for the dollar ?    When the Constitution used the term "" dollar "" in 1788 , it had a legal meaning then & there . Until you learn this , you will not understand .   We understand what you ’ re saying . Just trying to figure out what your point is . You ’ re demanding we go back to the same currency system ?   The Constitution requires government officials to perform all governmental fiscal transactions in silver & gold only .   Have the updated legislation throughout the centuries since been successfully challenged ? Why are you wasting so much energy screaming this into the wind ?   FYI — if so much energy was "" being wasted "" no one would be discussing this — which various States are . Must be difficult thinking you know everything . When you don't . 😉    These geniuses , are they telling us what value they will assign to gold In their state ? The original $ 19.39 ? If the founders said so , it ’ s basically gospel , yes ? Hell , I ’ ll grab cash and go get me some gold for it !","   The "" value "" of Money refers to the metal content of a coin . 😂 😂 😂",1

So in the past two days I have finished Mindhunter and The Witcher . Big up yourselves    I lost my way in Witchhunter mate . Couldn ’ t tell you who was who or what was happening . Had you played the game / known it before ?  Nah hadn't played the game but figured it out after a while ! There was a lot of time jumping which they didnt make clear but I managed to get it in the end !  I finished it ... but out of stubbornness ! Hahah I love a good fantasy fight scene so kept me for that . Thought your man was pretty beige too ! ?  Yeah I did at first too but realised that was part of his character . I was a bit gutted we didnt see the Bard again ! I have never been in to fantasy so I was popping my cherry but I liked it !  Yeah never watched either ! When GOT came out it was the choice of that or The Walking Dead to commit too and I sadly chose the later,   Giri / Haji is now available on . Or you can watch it on .,1

make way for taekook aka our gorgeous muse and escort ♥  how happy jungkook was and taehyung was so proud having the most handsome man 2019 on his side Exactly .. Then why are u glorifying it ? The title i mean . huh ? Jungkook is the winner in 2019 . ofc I can do it .. what is so wrong about it ?," Buddy , Taehyung also won the title himself , like Jk . It's nothing for Taehyung to be brag about . But ur tweet sounded like he should be because he is with the winner when Taehyung himself was the winner 2 yrs back ! U could have worded differently without glorifying one 🙃",1
"  Don't mind if I don't , thanks all the same . Just the other day you were gloating about all the new work opportunities , you racist cartoon had produced . Now you're back with cap in hand . Tsek .   Hands up all in the twittersphere who has “ donated ” to poor Jerms “ cause ” 😂 #IsThisWokeBegging #AskHelen 😂   More than you would be able can count , I hear Canada is lovely this time of year , enjoy it and let us worry about what ’ s going on around here   Ah yes ... the ol “ you in Canada do you have no more say as a SA citizen ” comment . 😂 Nope , never heard that one before #NotSurprised Seeing as you in the know , did this “ Jerm supporter ” also donate ? #AskingForAFriend 😁    I doubt it , it seems like this commentator , would rather use his money for therapy , we can all pull examples from every group that has a idiot like that , we aren ’ t all one track minded , don ’ t generalize to create your own narrative , no one can really control who comments what   Ps . As the administrator of a FB page , when the numerous racist comments are brought to your attention and you fail to act ... you become complicit . So pls dont come with some tired wishy washy “ no control ” excuse   See how it works , once someone reports this to FB , they automatically suspend the page , before Jerm can react to this it isn ’ t whisky washy as you would hope it ’ s fact , fact I know isn ’ t your forte , you just want a voice , a voice to make it appear all whites in sa are racist   Come now , i never said all whites are racist . Now you just making things up . 😂 Now on Jerms FB page ... theres another story . And he clearly states that he will allow the speech no matter the content because he does not believe in censoring","   All I said was that we should be careful generalizing , I firmly believe a Majority of people , from all races , religoen and creeds just want to coexist whiteout of fear or hate , we can start here but the government needs to reunite is , black or white this is all our home",1
"HALF TIME | Some unsavoury scenes during the half time break here in the Darlington end . Could result in a delay to the second half . ( 1-1 ) Absolutely right they all wanted to be on top of themselves in the smallest space in the ground , plenty of room down the side . danger to themselves .  Sadly not right . Very poorly organised , hopefully all ticket and less to Darlo next time as it was unsafe and people could have been seriously hurt .  Plenty space down the side but they wanted the same space in the worse part of the ground to watch the game . Wonder why ? Some people need to take responsibility for their own health . Enough space not enough brain cells  Not quite true though . People who were stood where you are saying advised no space . Poorly organised , I am sure the same mistakes won ’ t be made a second time .  Plenty space down the side an in the corner but these Muppets wanted to have a bit chew at the barrier . Too many of them . Not enough space for them all and certainty not enough brain cells I'm afraid . Sad when one of your lads from the stand came over to get his family out .  Some muppets in there is right but plenty space is not correct . I stood in the other parts and it was poor . Stewards opened that bit up and kept moving the line , so obviously people looking for a view would go in there . Really poor organisation .  Space for 900 and there was 850 of you , overcrowding by the muppets in area and still enough . Plenty of room and where I was stood there was plenty . You are right ticketed next time and you'll get less for the cuntfuckery hope decent fans like you get in .  I disagree that there was space and I was in that part of the ground . The fact it will be reduced next time will back up that it was poorly organised this time . The fence went due to a surge when a goal was scored as no crush barriers in that part which would stop the surge .   Incorrect , the fence was already wavering because of previous by louts at the front . The CCTV footage will demonstrated this when presented to the police .   When enough people and weight is put on the fence it's supposed to give way before human bones and organs do you bloody idiot . What don't you understand about that thickol 1976 🤔 💩   Dear me down to abuse , didn ’ t take long . Have you checked the ground guide which advises fences should be like crush barriers if none in place ?   Been a while since you or any Darlo fan has read ground regs . They're suppose to give if there's excessive weight put on them . Abuse is deserved when your thick as gloss . Plenty of space down near the pond end just all the dolts wanted to give it the big un .    Speaks more about you than me but heyho it ’ s the internet . Doesn ’ t show a lot of space to take all those people , when was the photo taken ? The video footage will advise more I guess . See a conversation with no abuse required 👍","   5 mins in the photo was taken . It's not going to take all the people but shows there's enough space if common sense was used . Issue is application of common sense it shouldn't have been left to the dolts to decide , or not . Another ground to the list your lot have damaged",1
"I am a son of the working class . I have stood up and fought for working families my whole life . That is who I am . The trolls working for Trump are doing a great job in here , trying to turn #votebluenomatterwho against each other . #BernieBeatsTrump  #VoteBlueNoMatter who is a ridiculous assertion . I ’ m assuming you believe Bernie will be the nominee , if not , will you still be all Blue ?  have done jack $ hit to earn my vote and “ not Trump ” is not a reason . I won ’ t vote Trump , but I won ’ t allow Dems to shove their   Yep , blue no matter who . No , although I'm going to vote for him in this primary , as I did in 2016 , I don't think he'll be the one . Blue or red , the country is pretty middle of the road .

"Tens of thousands of mourners gather in southwest #Iran city of Ahvaz to receive body of General #QassemSoleimani , who was killed in #Iraq in a US military strike . This is the first of several stops before Soleimani ’ s body is laid to rest in hometown of Kerman on Tuesday .   I was just thinking that ... but instead of Waldo , look for a woman .   It ’ s a Muslim funeral , women aren ’ t allowed to follow the funeral procession as “ wailing over the dead is considered unlawful ” - “ And if the wailing woman does not repent before she dies , she will be made to stand on the Day of Judgment ”   This is not true for Iranians my dear . Iranian shia Muslims don't obey by that rule . Women R welcome to come to funeral . If u Don't see women is because they don't like to be squished by such pressure . Google photos and u'll see women further back & in front .   It ’ s just a bunch of men . I guess women drove them there and dropped them off .   I think you can see better in this link how women are participating . Though media tends to not showcase women for some reason .   Any gay people . I know they are so welcome !",   Well that part is a sad truth that people aren't being educated properly about LGBTQ . All of it comes from lack of education and ignorance . I am however happy to see many young generation are not remaining closeted & stepping up .,1

"To battle depression , there's a list of things people recommend . 1 . Eat healthy 2 . Exercise 3 . Therapy 4 . Pills 5 . Get a good nights sleep 6 . Think more positively and the list goes on . Some of these things are easier said than done ( part 1 )Others are pretty much impossible when you're struggling to make ends meet , when your mom works 2 jobs and she's struggling to make ends meet .

"Because white people cannot be pro black ? Is that what are you saying ?  You can be #White and be pro-Black but you can ’ t be #White and know the culture 🤔 You need to go through a few things and therefore be #Black before you understand the culture But none of those songs specifically talked about culture , therefore no disrespect whatsoever Another prime example of how you can ’ t get it unless you are in it 🙄 if it doesn ’ t say “ CULTURE ” then it ’ s not about it 😩 Would you say Lemonade wasn ’ t about the culture ?

"The question that has never clearly been answered to me when I have posed it : “ What would Trump have to do to lose your support ? ” The long pauses and blank stares are scary . For those this applies to - feel free to answer . The economy is good , he is securing our borders , people are working which brings self worth . He is pro life , is protecting American interests worldwide , is working on prison reform and is protecting Christian liberties here and abroad . All of the things he said he would do .  anyone who votes for Trump due to religious beliefs is kidding themselves . Apparently , the chosen one is someone divorced multiple times , has 30 + sexual assault accusations against him , including raping a 13 yr old . Yes , raping a 13 yr old . That's who you vote for .  It is amazing how far the left will go to discredit someone . It certainly has been shown time and time again how low they will go . I mean 30 plus “ accusations ” is crazy , frankly surprised there are not more ! But great facts bro !  Lol - Trump is a victim . That explains your level of intelligence .  And as usual the left offers NOTHING of substance and resorts to personal attacks ! You folks are consistent . Appreciate you adding to the status quo ! Continue on ...  No reason to argue facts since your party doesn't deal in them . If Trump is Innocent he should be allowing witnesses and documents . But we all know he's not and that's because he's already , and will forever be , IMPEACHED .",  Continue living in your fantasy world ! Trump will be YOUR President until the year 2024 .

"In responding to  motion to show cause & compel production of Brady material , Mueller prosecutor Brandon Van Grack hints that  cooperation agreement req . turning over any comms sent to Flynn by ppl trying to help his defense , including from Congress THREADFor no substantive reason other than as a veiled warning to back off , Van Grack includes an email sent by Devin Nunes HPSCI staffer Derek Harvey via Barbara Ledeen to Flynn , which Flynn ’ s prior defense team immediately turned over to the gov ( & it appears not for the first time ) This aligns with Flynn ’ s defense team also turning over the voicemail from Trump ’ s WH lawyer Dowd to Mueller , which Team Mueller then misrepresented and truncated to remove context when producing the transcript in the Mueller reportThe rest of gov response : — Powell / Flynn requests are a “ fishing expedition ” — SCOTUS allows the gov to withhold impeachment evidence in a guilty plea scenario ( * true ) — Powell made up her mind before knowing the facts of case — Judge should dismiss motion , move to sentencing FlynnI should say , other than the snark , the rest of the government response is quite strong in many areas ( particularly narrowing the scope of the dispute to the single 1001 charge and citing Flynn ’ s repeated knowing waiver of rights ) and I think could be persuasive to Judge Sullivan You're assuming facts not in evidence 😊 Stay tuned .

"🎥 First Minister  says there must be “ cool heads ” on both sides as tensions increase between the US and Iran following the death of Major General Qassem Soleimani . #HeartNews    Indeed . Wise words . I'm challenged immensely by Iran . His death was however nothing short of murder and it is now the world's collective responsibility to determine if his death , his murder , is justifiable . Such a judgement will be yet another test of humanity .   Just like all the people those men murdered or crippled   One can not I feel condone the actions of such a military general however , as a society are we progressing if we allow some to act as judge , jury and executioner without collective input from others . My opinion only","   "" If we allow some to act as judge , jury and executioner ... "" just wtf do you think this dead iranian was doing ? 600 + American servicemembers dead because of him .

"WATCH : Jess Phillips says Labour must be prepared to advocate for EU membership if Boris Johnson's Brexit leaves the UK poorer and less safe . #Marr  Well she ’ s actually totally wrong on every count . Rejoining the EU would require economic convergence and adoption of the Euro ( or a currency peg ) and signing the Shengen agreement . All disastrous for the UK which has a negative current account balance . Happy now ? She didnt say she would rejoin . She said if the conditions proved true , that rejoining would be better economically , she would support that . Keep up champ .", “ If rejoining would be better economically ” - shows how little she knows about macro then doesn ’ t it ? Because rejoining would mean pegging our currency or joining the Euro which would turn us into Greece ( considering our Debt / GDP ratio and current account balance ),1

"Worth repeating . The testimony & evidence considered in a Senate impeachment trial should be the same testimony & evidence the House relied upon when they passed the Articles of Impeachment . Our job is to vote on what the House passed , not to conduct an open ended inquiry . No . You're 100 % wrong . A Trial requires : • Evidence • Witnesses Your job , Senator Rubio , is to be an * impartial * juror .  So does an indictment , and yet the House chose to pass the Articles anyway . Both things also require a crime , which was also lacking in the whole thing . They alleged a crime in the beginning , but then never included that crime in the Articles .   Which came first : the Constitution , or the USC ?   Does it matter if neither Abuse of Power nor Obstruction of Congress are codified as criminal acts ?   Yes it does matter that they are not crimes . Obstruction of congress is part of the duties of the executive branch . And abuse of power is so common , as well as a matter of opinion ( in most cases )   I think you misread my post . I was responding to the "" which came first "" question with my answer . It doesn't matter which came first as those things aren't crimes , so should not be the basis of an impeachment ( included with crimes , sure , but not stand alone ) .   Violation of the emoluments clauses is explicitly impeachable , which provides a practical bribery test , in the Constitution itself . By that very reasonable standard , bribery was committed .   There's a very good reason they didn't include a violation of the emoluments clause in their Articles : Trump donates all funds gained from foreign governments at his properties to the US Treasury .   Receiving them is the violation . You've got to apply being a stickler both directions .   Nope . Benjamin Franklin received a gift from some European country , France , I think it was . Congress then declared that he could keep it . Congress can't make a decision about whether a government agent can keep a gift unless the gift is known , which is after it's given .   Gifting , particularly among governments , are not hecessarily spontaneous , and a strict reading of the Constitution calls for prior consent of Congress . Congress makes decisions about things that haven't happened yet all the time . It's what they actually do for a day job .   No , that's not the way it's ever been interpreted precisely because most gifts are not known of ahead of time . But you're right about Congress making decisions on things that haven't happened yet . They decided in 2016 to impeach Trump for something that didn't happen until 2018   GOP shouldn't beat that horse . They were after Obama from day one , impeachment ( you may recall "" that's change I can believe in "" t - shirts ) , make him a one-term President declared for the record by #moscowmitch on #Senate floor , or just by hook or crook .   But how many times did they actually try to draft Articles or open an Impeachment inquiry ? I can't find any . Some Democrats tried to draft Articles 3 or 4 times prior to this , mostly based on tweets Trump sent .   Trump didn't suddenly become an authoritarian man-child who would be king . Decades of visibility there . America allowed a person who has operated within his businesses with absolute authority to become president of a democratic republic . That amounts to implanting a cancer .   Trump isn't an authoritarian man-child now . No , Trump is not a cancer . Put down the FakeNews before you have a stroke .   That's all he is , nothing more . Well , #putinpuppet fits in there somewhere .   Ah yes , the disproven Russia angle . So is Trump an evil genius that can evade detection by 4 federal investigations into ties to the Russian government ? Or are you a "" useful idiot "" for keeping up the conspiracy that the media peddled for years and Mueller said didn't happen ?",   Why not ! The thinks Hillary has superhuman abilities to survive capture on every front of [ alleged ] wrongdoing .,1

"I want to share one of my favourite song . 🤗 I first heard this song when I was about 13 years old & it's forever imprinted in my heart . Just watching the MV itself was both shocking & encouraging for the young me back then . #ChristinaAguilera Growing up in a rural area in an Asian country , many "" ideas "" presented in this MV was unthinkable for me at that time yet it was surprisingly easy for me to accept . It was also around this age when I realized I'm relatively more open & my thinking different from others around me .I guess my depression already started though back then I wasn't really aware , thought that harming myself to feel better is normal / OK . But this song's lyrics & video really left a mark on me . What about "" flaws "" ? What about "" differences "" ? There's so many out there , I am not alone .Even the starting lyrics ' are powerful . "" Everyday is so wonderful Then suddenly It's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed "" This . Even now , I still don't know why I'm like this . I'm just suffering . #ChristinaAguilera"" I am beautiful No matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful In every single way Yes words can't bring me down So don't you bring me down today "" It's what I'm desperately struggling to coax myself with every single day . #ChristinaAguilera",""" To all your friends you're delirious So consumed In all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone Left the puzzle undone Ain't that the way it is "" What else can I say ? It always feel wrong . I always feel alone , incomplete #ChristinaAguilera",1

"Good luck to everyone marching for independence in Glasgow today - hope the weather isn ’ t too bad ! Sorry I can ’ t be there today , but look forward to seeing you all again soon . In the meantime , sending my support and best wishes . I'm British . And unfortunately I am loosing my EU citizenship . I am seruously considering moving to Scotland in the next few years , so as to be able to stay near my admin and yet retain my EU citizenship rights . Do you think this will be a possibility ?  Independence doesn't mean Scotland staying in the EU . I'm afraid you've been misled .   Tells us why it would be beneficial for Scotland stay in the union ? I mean anything would be good ... 👂 ! ! ? ? ? !   The pooling and sharing of resources that means that when different parts of the UK do well , they can fund those parts doing less well , and ensure public services are maintained . In the 80s and early 90s Scotland was a net contributor , in the years since we have had net benefit .   London Docklands was unproductive wasteland in 1980s . Investments from rest of country resulted in development and is now massive contributor to UK revenues including to Scotland .   Total bollocks both of you . Scotland , like many regions of England has been starved of investment and any joined up economic planning . The only for Scotland to prosper is to take control of our own resources . Pooling and sharing is a myth .   Economic planning is devolved . You should complain to the SNP . Independence means losing billions of pounds a year . Pooling and sharing is very , very real and we'd find out the hard way if we dividing the UK as you want to .   Really ? The Scottish gov decided to invest billions in HS2 , London Crossrail , the Olympics development , Trident renewal , tax breaks for oil companies etc . Scotland is a wealthy country with enormous potential .   Too many myths ( HS2 , Crossrail , Olympics etc ) to bother with there . And infrastructure investment in any part of the economy benefits whole economy through added productivity .   Myths ? More nonsense . You don't think direct investment in Scotland on the scale there has been in SE England would be of greater benefit to the Scottish economy ?   As I've pointed out before the fiscal transfer is a myth . Even if it were true don't you think it would be a better idea to have an economic policy the whole country would benefit from ?   The whole country does benefit . That's what the map shows . Haven't you got a march to go to ?   So the whole country would benefit from investing in Scotland instead wouldn't it ? As for marches we can get tens of thousands to march on a terrible day like this the union can't get anyone except your pals in the OO to March in the middle of summer .   We don't organise marches . We don't want to change Scotland's place in the UK .",   2014 demonstrated the effectiveness of the wonderful democratic institution that is the secret ballot .

"What is the secret of your joy ? Lao Tzu is a celebrated Zen master today , even then he gathered a certain number of disciples around him . It ’ s part of the Zen tradition that when the master or the guru is dying , people gather around for a final message . So in his last days , people gathered around him , and asked , “ Master , what is the secret of your joy ? ” Lao-tzu faced lot of extreme situations in his life . He was accused of things that he had never thought of , and he went through troubles .So people asked , “ You went through so many things , but you were always joyful . What is the secret of your joy ? ” Lao Tzu said , “ Oh that ! It ’ s just that every day in the morning when I woke up , I used to get a question .The question is ' Today shall I be joyful or miserable ? ' Till now I just happened to choose joy , that ’ s all . ” So have you made your choice ? Every day in the morning , ask yourself a question “ Today , you ’ re going to be joyful or miserable ? ” .You must make this choice every day , “ Today , I am going to be joyful . ” Joy is not a goal by itself . It is just that when you ’ re joyful , you are pleasant to the world . When you are joyful , you are sensible in your head .","When you are joyful , you will not do stupid things against yourself .

"Since some people are having a meltdown over the multi-racial cast of the Amazon Lord of the Rings show , it's worth remembering that Tolkien held a lot of troubling views and it's good that people adapting his work don't reproduce them . Take his views on women : 1/5  Your views are based on a very superficial reading of Tolkien's work and opinions . As are those complaining about a multiracial cast for whatever Amazon are trying to create .  Tolkien literally said women can only learn if they want to have their [ male ] teacher's children , and that a woman who enjoys being the instigator of a sexual relationship is depraved . What is the non-misogynistic reading of that ?  Where did he say that ? I've read his published letters and I'm pretty sure I'd have remembered that .

You call 311 for them to come and put sand down at the intersections and I could do a better job with a 5 gallon pail of sand .  Totally agree , I've also contacted 311 and complained . That was Saturday , and there is still virtually nothing on the streets . #FAIL",  But they are clearing the bike lanes down to the pavement . I drive the Henday every day and there isn't a speck of ice or snow on the main driving lanes . Yet I exit off the Henday and I got to drive 20km / h cause i'll slide into the car in front of me if I try to stop .,1

"I know a lot of decent Republicans and conservatives in Arizona , who are fed up with the indecency of Trump and elected officials like  who emulate him . Enough to decide the outcome of close statewide elections in Arizona in 2020 .    Why , she said the truth ? Your statement here shows how fake you are . She is the truth teller . Anyone who has watched for decades as I have cannot stand by and call them a trusted news source anymore . They are clearly a constant one sided ideological reporting agent . #truth   She refused to answer a question from the free press . You are siding with open fascism .   What a stupid statement . If not answering the press is fascism what is only covering one political ideology . I think that ’ s probably closer to fascism but I gather you don ’ t understand what real fascism is .

Have you seen anyone on Fox News refer to law enforcement as "" law enforcement "" rather than "" Deep State "" ? Has Fox News apologized for known falsehoods about Seth Rich ?   Joelle , if you want to see "" both sides "" you need to know actual facts . The question the reporter asked McSally was whether she would consider new facts at the Senate trial . To refuse to answer THAT question from ANYONE is absurd .   I ’ m not discussing THAT ISSUE . I ’ m discussing the following , I don ’ t want to continue talking to someone who can ’ t admit the simple thing . Journalism is dead . It is no longer an unbiased important estate . It is political ideology and used to be revered . They are now HACKS   Journalism always had and always will involve some bias . There is no such thing as impartial . People have to choose what to cover , what headlines to write . That was certainly true when the first amendment was written .   You were the one who raised the issue of bias when you defended McSally - - who refused to answer an entirely appropriate question - - by following the Trump talking points of attacking the media for daring to ask .   Actually Joelle , you might even agree with this one : ",   You are condescendingly disrespectful and all that is wrong with liberalism that I hold near and dear .

I hate to break it back to you but ...

Just justify your position by signing into law the reforms act sir .  you know as it is the time has elapsed ... it has to come from the Senate again  So what stopped him from signing it before the last election ?  2 reasons ... one we were not ready for that ... not everywhere in Nigeria has network coverage ... even card reader hasn't funstoned well ... to do that u need to start it with isolated elections in states first . 2 . security information had it that Atiku was going to hack the server,"  That means we would never be ready , because the network issues wouldn't be resolved soon Then the speculation or rumour that Atiku was going to hack the server was a ground to strengthen or tighten the server wasn't it ? Bottom line , we might never get there as a country",1

"In the Clinton impeachment process , 66 witnesses were allowed to testify including 3 in the Senate trial , and 90,000 pages of documents were turned over . Trump was too afraid to let any of his top aides testify & covered up every single document . The Senate must #EndTheCoverUp  Nancy , if you weren ’ t determined to rush through a sham impeachment , this wouldn ’ t be an issue now would it ? ! ? You could have called all the witnesses you wanted in the House , but you didn ’ t . YOU screwed up ! Don ’ t whine now . 👍  In what way was it a Sham Bradley - give us details . We'll wait .   It wasn't a sham ! Some witnesses were blocked by Trump & going to court to contest could have taken months . The Democrats in the House handled the impeachment investigation admirably , despite so many of the questioning the witnesses behaved like clowns . #Coverup   Going to court when 2 branches of gov ’ t have deference ’ s in opinion , based on the LAW , is what #Presidents have done for decades . No news here . What is telling is the #fact Democrats have been calling for #impeachment from DAY ONE ! 👉 👉    So why didn't Trump go to court to block the witnesses from testifying - are you saying it is one rule for Trump and another rule for those trying to expose him ?   He did . Case pending.Stay tuned . Dem ’ s too impatient to wait for court verdict , so they charged #President w / obstruction . 🤷 🏻 ‍ ♀ ️ 👉  But hey , Sure is EXPOSING lots of corruption , right ? ! Time to bring these bad players into the arena : 👉    He did not go to court to get witnesses blocked from testifying - that is just a lie by you . Which is standard for republicans now days . As for your links . FAUX NEWS ? ? ? HANNITY ? ? ? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA   Maybe this article can help you understand , hard to explain with just a few characters :    As far as the links , #Democrats own words condemn them . #FactsMatter   Weak . If "" facts "" mattered , you wouldn't use a The Hill opinion piece & a Fox News clip about "" the whistleblower "" to support your stance . Btw , even if the whistleblower turns out to be less than impartial , TRUMP deserved impeachment for abuse of power & obstruction of Congress .   Their ( #Democrats ) own words ! 😂 🤣 😂 THINK ! All that matters , is the #fact THEY said it ! They wrote the emails . They talked about a #coup . They said DAY ONE . They own it ! Sorry if that offends you .   It doesn't matter if a Democratic politician , or 2 or 3 , or more , desperately wanted Trump impeached ( or even said "" coup "" ) , TRUMP provided cause . He obstructed the Mueller investigation , & even AFTER THAT committed the Ukraine abuse of power & obstruction . He's a knucklehead .   That ’ s not what Mueller said . In fact , he found NOTHING to charge #President . If he could ’ ve he would ’ ve . But his #coup attempt failed w / all the MILLIONS he spent , couldn ’ t find that needle ! 😫 I didnt like #Obama either , but unlike you I would never suppt a . Just saying 🤷 🏻 ‍ ♀ ️ .   You clearly have not read the Mueller report . The report clearly states at least 10 items with which Trump can ( and probably will ) be charged with when he leaves office . OLC told him he could not charge him whilst he was serving . ","   Watched him testify too . to watch . What I pictured & what sat in #Congress was painful to watch .
